# Installs the prebuilt `kirocrew` wheel for a release channel. It resolves the
# channel feed, verifies its RSA-SHA256 signature against the public key pinned
# below, downloads the wheel over HTTPS from CloudFront, verifies its SHA-256

# Python: provisions a python-build-standalone CPython via a SHA-256-pinned uv

# works on old-glibc distros (CentOS 7). Opt out with --system-python to run on

KiroCrew CLI installer (channel / wheel based).

Installs the prebuilt `kirocrew` wheel for a release channel: resolves the
channel feed, verifies its signature against the installer-pinned public key,
downloads the wheel over HTTPS, verifies its SHA-256 against the signed digest,
then installs it (pipx if available, else a managed venv BESIDE the data home —
"$KIROCREW_HOME"-venv or ~/.kiro/crew-venv, never inside the data home itself).
