"""Refuse an owner-only lockdown applied to a published path AFTER content.

A secret-bearing file must be locked down BEFORE any content reaches it.
Applying the lockdown once the payload is already at its final path leaves a
window in which the file exists under whatever permissions it inherited -- on
Windows that is the parent directory's DACL, and POSIX mode bits are not
enforced there at all, so ``atomic_write(mode=0o600)`` does not close it.

Issue #5307 converted seven such writers to
``atomic_write(..., restrict_to_owner=True)``, which locks the temp file down
before the first content byte and before the rename. Nothing prevented a NEW
writer from reintroducing the shape; this checker does.

A violation is, within ONE function body, an owner-only lockdown applied to a
path expression that an EARLIER statement in that same function already wrote
content to, where that path is the PUBLISHED one.

Deliberately NOT violations -- flagging these would make the gate worse than no
gate:

* a lockdown on a temp path the same function LATER renames into place, in any
  spelling (``os.replace(tmp, final)``, ``tmp.rename(final)``, or
  ``tmp.replace(target=final)``): the published file is never exposed, and this
  is the shape ``atomic_write`` uses. The rename must come AFTER the lockdown
  and in the same scope -- an EARLIER rename means the path was rotated aside
  and the payload written to it afterwards, which is the defect, not the fix;
* the delegated form ``atomic_write(..., restrict_to_owner=True)``, which is
  the fix this checker exists to protect;
* ``chmod``/``chmod_safe``/``fchmod_safe`` with a mode that grants anything to
  group or other
  -- making a launcher executable (``0o755``) is not a lockdown. Owner-only is
  tested as a property, so the symbolic spellings (``stat.S_IRWXU``,
  ``stat.S_IRUSR | stat.S_IWUSR``) count the same as ``0o700``/``0o600``;
* ``fd = os.open(p, O_CREAT...)`` then ``restrict_to_owner(p)`` then writing
  through the descriptor: ``os.open`` creates an EMPTY file, so the lockdown
  lands before any content. The content-write moment for that idiom is
  ``os.fdopen(fd, ...)``, and only a lockdown after THAT is a violation;
A path reached through a single-assignment local alias (``target = secret_path``)
counts as the same path; anything less tractable -- a name rebound in a branch, an
attribute, a write and lockdown split across two functions -- is outside the rule
by construction, so a green run is not proof the shape is absent.

Deliberately NOT violations (continued):

* a site carrying ``# lockdown-ok: <reason>`` on the lockdown line. The reason
  is mandatory, and there are three legitimate kinds: a load-time re-assert; a
  file that holds no data; or a call site where a REVIEWED decision says the
  helper must not be used here at all -- ``workflows/store.py::save`` runs on
  the event loop, where ``restrict_to_owner``'s Windows DACL write costs an
  unbounded SMB round-trip on a network-homed data home, so #5228 settled it on
  POSIX ``chmod`` with a ``_redact``-ed payload.

  The marker and ``KNOWN_UNCONVERTED`` are not interchangeable, and picking the
  wrong one misreports the site. ``KNOWN_UNCONVERTED`` means "this SHOULD be
  converted and has not been yet", so it is watched: the shrink-only rule fails
  once the debt is paid. The marker means "converting this would be wrong", so
  there is nothing to watch -- filing such a site as debt would instead tell the
  next contributor to make the change the decision rejected.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_lockdown_before_publish.py [PATH ...]

Exits non-zero and prints ``file:line`` per violation. With no arguments it
scans ``src/kiro_crew``. Sites tracked by an open conversion issue live in
``KNOWN_UNCONVERTED``; that list is shrink-only.
