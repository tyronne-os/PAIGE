"""check_changelog_history.py — shipped changelog sections are immutable.

``CHANGELOG.md`` is append-only history. A release prepends one
``## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`` section; every section already in the file describes
software a user has already installed, so a line deleted from one is
unrecoverable from that user's artifact.

## Why this is a deterministic gate and not a review rule

This exact loss already happened. A commit titled ``docs: add 0.3.0-insider.9
changelog`` *replaced* the file instead of prepending to it: 53 insertions and
322 deletions, taking the entire ``[0.2.0]``, ``[0.1.3]`` and ``[0.1.2]``
sections with it. It read as plausible in review, because the insertions are
what a reader looks at and the deletions were buried in the same hunk. Nothing
failed; the loss surfaced only when a user noticed the dashboard's Releases page
had gone nearly empty.

So the judgment half of the rule (is this a commit dump? should this PR be
touching the file at all?) stays in ``AUTOSDE.yaml`` where a reviewer applies it,
and the **mechanically checkable** half lives here, where no reviewer has to
notice anything. Two invariants:

    1. every version section present at the base ref must still be present at
       head, byte-identical
    2. head must contain ONLY shipped sections -- no ``## [Unreleased]``, no
       prerelease heading

with **no exemptions**. A section whose heading is a bare ``X.Y.Z`` describes
shipped software and is immutable, full stop.

Rule 2 is what makes rule 1 sufficient. Together they leave exactly one legal
shape for a changelog diff -- prepend one new section -- because there is no
draft section to append a per-PR line to and every released one is frozen. A
release's notes are written once, when the version is bumped, under the
release's own heading.

A **prerelease** heading (``## [0.3.0-insider.9]``, ``## [0.3.0-rc.2]``) is not a
shipped section -- it is a draft of a release that has not happened -- so
:func:`compare` skips it there exactly like ``## [Unreleased]``, and
:func:`draft_headings` refuses it at head. The two are not in tension: history is
read from refs that may legitimately contain such a heading, while the tree being
proposed may not introduce one. An earlier design used a prerelease heading as a
deliberate in-progress state on a release branch, to be renamed when the entry
was written. That state is what accumulated 0.4.0's 721-line unedited draft, and
it renders as "no notes" against the version the reader is actually running.

An earlier version of this check exempted "the newest section at the base ref" so
a release branch could redraft its own entry. That was wrong in a way worth
recording: on ``main`` the newest section at base is the **last shipped release**,
so the exemption made the most recently shipped section -- the one the most users
are running -- the single editable one. Keying on "newest" confused *position in
the file* with *not yet released*. Prerelease-versus-bare is the property that
actually distinguishes a draft from history, and it needs no tag lookup, so it
works in a shallow CI checkout.

Correcting a genuine factual error inside a shipped section is still possible; it
is simply not silent. The gate flags it, and the author says in the PR body that
this is what they are doing (the AUTOSDE rule's stated allowance) so a human
approves it deliberately.

``release.yml``'s stable gate is the complement of this check: it verifies the
new section *exists*. It does not verify the old ones survived, which is the
half that actually failed.

## One source of truth for folding

``0.3.0-insider.9``, ``0.3.0-rc.2`` and ``0.3.0`` are one release. The renderer
(``src/kiro_crew/changelog.py``) owns that folding, and this gate **loads it from
there** by path rather than re-implementing it. ``changelog.py`` imports only
``re`` and ``typing``, so it loads in a CI job that checked the tree out without
installing the package. A second copy of the regex was the earlier design and it
failed in the dangerous direction: a spelling the renderer folds but the gate does
not would make a legitimate release-branch rewrite read as a deleted section, or
let a real deletion pass.

## Usage

    # enforce against a base ref (exit 1 on any violation)
    CHANGELOG_BASE_REF="$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)" \
        python3 scripts/check_changelog_history.py

    # self-test: one probe per rule family, assert each verdict
    python3 scripts/check_changelog_history.py --test

With no ``CHANGELOG_BASE_REF`` the check has nothing to compare against and
exits 0 with a note, so running it locally without a base is not a failure.

Pass the MERGE BASE, not the base branch's moving tip. CI passes
``pull_request.base.sha`` and tests the merge ref, so the two agree there; locally
they do not. A branch that is merely BEHIND a base which has since gained a release
reports that release as ``GONE`` -- the section is missing from the head being
compared, which is true and useless. The merge base is the commit the branch
actually departed from, so it answers "did THIS branch remove anything".
