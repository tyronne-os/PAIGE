"""ratchet_scope.py -- one answer to "which files and lines does THIS change touch".

The merge-ref ratchets (``check_black_formatting.py``,
``check_subprocess_encoding.py``, ``check_agent_sdk_boundary.py``,
``check_sync_io_in_async.py``) record a pre-existing violation set as legacy and
then judge only what the change in front of them adds. All four need the same pair
of answers -- the changed-file set and the added-line set -- and they must agree:
a scope fix applied to one private copy and not the others would make the same
added line red under one gate and green under another, for no reason a
contributor could see.

Two gate families share this module and differ ONLY in how the base is named.
The merge-ref family above discovers the checkout shape itself
(``changed_paths()`` / ``added_lines()``). ``check_brand_name.py``,
``check_harness_parity.py`` and ``check_focus_cue.py`` are handed an explicit
base ref instead (``*_BASE_REF``, resolved inside Actions to the PR's
``base.sha`` so a run never picks up base moves landing after it started); they
use the ``*_at`` entry points below (``resolve_base`` / ``changed_paths_at`` /
``added_lines_at``), which keep that env-provided base semantics while sharing
the diff PARSING — N private parsers meant the same added line could be judged
differently by different gates, and a scope fix to one copy left the others
wrong.

``changed_paths`` names each checkout shape it tries and reports the winner,
because they fail in ways that look alike and an earlier version of the black
gate silently fell back to whole-tree scope on CI. ``added_lines`` reads the diff
endpoints that SAME answer named, so both descriptions are of one diff -- an
added-line set computed against a different base than the changed-file set is
worse than no added-line set at all.

    * A local ``git merge origin/main`` on a feature branch puts the FEATURE

      under-scopes, and a local run passes a gate CI goes on to fail.

    Which shape this is is decided by which parent the base branch can reach:
    on the CI shape ``HEAD^1`` IS a commit of the base. The base refs tried
    here are the same pair, in the same order, as the three-dot fallback's, so

    an earlier version of the black gate fall back to whole-tree scope on CI
    without saying so, and then report a file the base branch had merged.

    * A ``pull_request`` checkout leaves HEAD as the MERGE commit, whose tree is
      the base tree plus this change. So ``diff HEAD^1 HEAD`` is exactly this
      change -- but only once ``_first_parent_is_base`` confirms, against a
      resolvable base ref, that ``HEAD^1`` really is the base: a local
      ``git merge origin/main`` is ALSO a merge at HEAD, with the parents the
      other way around, and taking ``HEAD^1..HEAD`` there would scope to what
      main brought in instead of this change.
    * ``diff HEAD^1 HEAD^2`` is equivalent but needs BOTH parents' trees, which a

    * Locally HEAD is the branch tip -- or an unrecognised merge -- so the
