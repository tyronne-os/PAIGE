"""check_black_formatting.py -- black as a real gate, behind a shrinking baseline.

## The problem this replaces

``AGENTS.md`` lists ``black src/kiro_crew test`` as a gate to run before every
commit, and CI does not check it. That combination is worse than having no gate,
because the instruction is not merely unenforced, it is actively harmful to
follow: 1,420 files under ``src/`` and ``test/`` are not black-clean, so running
the documented command reformats about 95,800 lines that have nothing to do with
the change being made. A contributor who obeys the documentation buries their own
diff; one who notices has to knowingly skip a documented gate and hope no
reviewer objects. Both outcomes were observed on real PRs.

The bulk format pass that would make the command safe has been "pending" long
enough for the note in ``ci.yml`` to go stale by a factor of three (it estimates
~406 files). Blocking enforcement on that pass landing is what let this rot, so
this gate does not wait for it.

## The ratchet

Every file is required to be black-clean *except* those recorded in the baseline:

* a file **not** in the baseline must be clean -- no new unformatted code lands,
  which is the property the missing gate was supposed to provide;
* a file **in** the baseline that has *become* clean must be **removed** from it,
  so the list shrinks instead of rotting.

Nothing demands that a baselined file be reformatted, so no PR is forced to carry
unrelated churn. Touching one is still free: it stays listed until someone
formats it deliberately.

This deliberately mirrors ``check_per_file_coverage.py`` -- same offender/graduate
vocabulary, same prune-only refresh -- because the repository already solved
"large pre-existing violation set, must only shrink" once, and a second shape for
the same problem is a second thing to learn.

## Scope

The "new offender" verdict covers only the files THIS change touches. Judging the
whole tree sounds stricter but is not: the base branch keeps merging files that
are not black-clean until this gate is live, and CI evaluates a PR's merge ref, so
an unscoped gate reddens a PR for someone else's file with no rebase involved. That
happened three times while landing this, which is how the scoping earned its place.

When no base ref is resolvable -- a bare push, a detached checkout -- the scope
falls back to the whole tree rather than to nothing: a scoping mechanism that fails
open would disable the gate exactly when its inputs are unusual.

## Refreshing

``--update-baseline`` only ever DELETES lines: entries that are now clean, and
entries whose file is gone. It never adds a path, so a new offender can never be
silenced by running the refresh -- that is the one rule which keeps the gate from
being a formality. There is deliberately no operation that adds one.
