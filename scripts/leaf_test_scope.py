"""Run only the test files a test-only PR touched, repeated, instead of the suite.

Why this reduction is sound when the general one is not
------------------------------------------------------
`run_scoped_tests.py` deliberately refuses to narrow WITHIN a surface, and its
docstring says why: answering "which tests reach this changed module?" needs a
real import graph, and six review rounds proved a text scan cannot enumerate the
ways a test can reach a module.

This script does NOT retry that. It answers two questions that are decidable
without an import graph, and it escalates to the full suite on anything else:

    1. Does any OTHER file depend on the test files this diff touched?
    2. Can this diff change the SET of test files, rather than only their contents?

Question 1 is a reverse lookup over a closed set of names, not an open-ended
reachability guess. Question 2 is the load-bearing one, and it is why this
version does not repeat the earlier failure: two independent reviewers found a
tree-scanning gate the first version's regex missed (`test_workflows_presence`
reaches the tree via `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` + `.glob(...)`, never the
`/ "test"` join it looked for). Enumerating join spellings is the same losing
game as enumerating import spellings, so the rule changed instead of the regex:

    A diff that only MODIFIES existing leaf test files cannot change the set of
    test files, so no gate that asserts on that SET can flip.

Adding, deleting or renaming a test file escalates to the full suite. That closes
the whole class -- presence gates, ignore-list assertions, "every module has a
referencing test" -- by construction, with no pattern to keep current.

What a modify-only leaf diff can still break, and how each is closed
--------------------------------------------------------------------
* Another test IMPORTS the changed module (`test_chat_backfill` imports
  `test_chat_slack`; `test_connections_handoff` imports autouse fixtures from
  `test_connections_warm`). Closed by the reverse-import scan.
* Another test reaches it DYNAMICALLY -- five files do
  `importlib.import_module("test_slack_golden_transcript")`, which no
  import-statement pattern sees. Closed by ALSO escalating when the changed
  module's name appears as a quoted string anywhere else in the tree. That is
  deliberately over-broad (a mention in a comment escalates too) because it is
  spelling-independent: it covers `importlib`, `__import__`,
  `pytest.importorskip`, a `sys.modules` patch, and whatever comes next.
* A CORPUS GATE reads the `test/` tree as DATA and asserts on its CONTENTS, so
  editing a test file can flip a gate that names none of them
  (`test_jsondecodeerror_redundancy_ratchet` carries `test/` in `SCAN_ROOTS`).
  Closed by always appending every test that scans a directory and reaches the
  test tree in ANY form -- the `/ "test"` join or a `__file__`-relative parent.
  Derived, not hardcoded, and an empty derivation forfeits the reduction, because
  a dead scan and a working one look identical.

Repeats, and what they are for
------------------------------
The CHANGED files run REPEAT times in separate pytest processes: a flaky test run
once in isolation usually passes, so a single green would prove nothing about the
fix it is gating, and separate processes re-roll per-process state and load order
(this repo has no pytest-repeat, and separate processes are stronger anyway).

The corpus gates run ONCE. They are deterministic content assertions -- repeating
them buys nothing and, at ~3 minutes a pass, would dominate the run.

This does NOT reproduce whole-suite conditions: a flake that needs a specific
xdist worker neighbour cannot appear here. That residual is the price of the
reduction, and it is bounded to test outcomes, since a modify-only leaf diff
changes no production code path. Force the full matrix with `ci-full-run`.

Usage
-----
    SCOPED_TESTS_BASE_REF="$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)" \\
        python3 scripts/leaf_test_scope.py --plan
    ... --targets     # bare list for CI: changed files first, then gates
    ... --gates       # just the run-once gate list
    ... --run         # execute (gates once, changed files repeated)
    ... --repeat 5    # override the repeat count (default 3)
    ... --files test/test_a.py    # decide for an explicit MODIFIED list
    ... --test        # self-test

Exit codes: 0 eligible / run green, 1 tests failed, 2 usage or environment error,
3 NOT eligible -- the caller must run the full suite.
