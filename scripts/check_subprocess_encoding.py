"""check_subprocess_encoding.py -- no text-mode subprocess without a pinned encoding.

## The failure class

``subprocess.run(cmd, text=True)`` (or ``universal_newlines=True``) with no
``encoding=`` decodes the child's output with ``locale.getpreferredencoding``:
UTF-8 on POSIX, the legacy ANSI code page on Windows. Any non-ASCII byte the
child prints -- a path, a commit message, a translated error -- comes back as
mojibake, or raises ``UnicodeDecodeError`` under strict decoding. Issue #3219
was this class reaching users through the dashboard's file diffs; #3669 fixed
the confirmed sites. This gate (#5249) keeps the class from growing back.

## What counts as a violation

A call to a subprocess-spawning function (``run``, ``Popen``, ``check_output``,
``check_call``, ``call`` -- as attribute or bare name -- plus this repository's
kwargs-forwarding wrappers ``run_limited`` and ``popen_limited``) that requests
text mode without pinning the decode. Text mode is requested by a ``text=`` or
``universal_newlines=`` keyword that is not a literal falsy, or by a ``**{...}``
dict-literal splat carrying such a key. The decode is pinned by an ``encoding=``
keyword whose value is not the literal ``None`` (``encoding=None`` is byte-for-
byte the locale fallback this gate exists to stop), or by a ``**UTF8_TEXT``
splat (the shared mapping from ``kiro_crew.subprocess_utf8``, which carries the
encoding).

Matching is BY NAME, deliberately: resolving imports would miss the wrappers
and monkeypatched aliases this repository actually uses, and an aliased
``from subprocess import run as spawn`` is an evasion this gate does not try to
outrun -- the marker below is the sanctioned escape. The cost is that an
unrelated ``client.run(x, text=True)`` is flagged; the fix there is one marker
or a real ``encoding=``, and no such call exists in the tree today.

The check is AST-based so a call formatted across multiple lines is judged as
one call, which a regex cannot do reliably. A file that does not parse is a
hard ERROR, never "clean": under a shrink-only ratchet a parse failure that
reads as zero violations would invite a prune that deletes the file's real
entry (the same fail-loud rule the black gate pins for "black exited 1 with no
findings").

## The opt-out marker

Some children genuinely write in the console/locale encoding (``systeminfo``,
user shells); pinning UTF-8 there would trade one mojibake for another. Such a
site opts out with an inline COMMENT on any line of the call:

    subprocess.run(cmd, text=True)  # subprocess-encoding: locale

Only a real comment token counts -- the phrase inside a string literal on the
call's lines does not exempt it. The marker is an audit trail, not an escape
hatch: it asserts the author chose locale decoding on purpose.

## The ratchet

The repository predates this gate, so existing violations are recorded in
``.github/subprocess-encoding-baseline.txt`` as ``<count> <path>`` lines. The
rules mirror ``check_black_formatting.py`` (same problem: a large pre-existing
violation set that must only shrink):

* a file NOT in the baseline must be clean;
* a baselined file may not grow its count;
* in a file this change touches, a violation sitting on an ADDED line is a new
  offender even when the count is level -- otherwise fixing one old call while
  adding one new one would slip through the count unchanged;
* a baselined file whose count has shrunk (or that is clean or gone) must be
  pruned so the list only shrinks -- run ``--update-baseline``, which only ever
  lowers counts and deletes lines, never adds or raises one.

Like the black gate, the "new offender" verdict covers only the files this
change touches (CI evaluates a merge ref, so an unscoped gate would redden a PR
for files the base branch merged after the baseline was recorded). The
count-shrink prune demand is likewise scoped to this change's files: a stale
count caused by someone else's merged cleanup is their prune to record, and
reddening an unrelated PR for it would make this gate's colour depend on other
people's hygiene.
