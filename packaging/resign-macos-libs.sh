# Ad-hoc re-sign native extension libraries in a Python environment's
# site-packages so macOS code-signing validation does not SIGKILL the
# interpreter when it loads them.
#
# Why this exists: pip wheels ship `.so`/`.dylib` files with a lightweight
# "linker-signed" ad-hoc signature (codesign flags 0x20002). On recent macOS
# (Apple Silicon, with the hardware-backed Code Signing Monitor) that flavor is
# validated flakily — when a code page fails the per-page hash check on
# demand-paging, the kernel kills the process with
# `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid))` /
# `CODESIGNING, Code 2, Invalid Page`. This bites numpy especially (numpy.random
# loads ~9 compiled extensions), breaking `make test` and the backend build
# in `make desktop` / `make backend-bin`.
#
# Re-signing with `codesign --force --sign -` replaces the linker-signed
# signature with a normal ad-hoc one (flags 0x2) carrying complete, valid
# per-page hashes, which the kernel validates deterministically.
#
# Usage: resign-macos-libs.sh [PYTHON]
#   PYTHON  interpreter whose site-packages to re-sign (default: python3)
#
# No-op on non-macOS. Safe to run repeatedly (idempotent).

# macOS-only; silently succeed elsewhere so the build flow stays portable.
