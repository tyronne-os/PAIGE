"""Generate the signing manifest with full nested Mach-O coverage.

Why this exists: Apple notarization requires EVERY nested Mach-O binary to be
Developer-ID signed with hardened runtime + secure timestamp. The signing
service only auto-detects frameworks/dylibs under Contents/Frameworks; everything under
Contents/Resources (our embedded Python backend: the interpreter, every .so
C-extension, every vendored .dylib) plus Squirrel's ShipIt helper must be
listed explicitly in `embedded_requirements`, or notarization returns
`Invalid` (confirmed: submission 3fefb424, 72 rejected binaries).

The binary set changes whenever a Python dependency changes, the app is
renamed, or Electron is upgraded, so EVERYTHING is generated at sign time
from the actual .app rather than maintained by hand:
  - backend entries (Resources Mach-Os + ShipIt) via collect_entries()
  - Electron shell entries (helper .apps, Electron Framework + its Helpers)
    via collect_shell_entries(), identifiers read from each bundle's
    Info.plist

A fail-closed layout tripwire (validate_layout) aborts the sign with a clear
message when the bundle contains something this generator does not
understand (a Mach-O outside the known scopes, or a nested bundle under
Contents/Resources, which needs bundle-level signing that per-file entries
cannot provide). Unknown layouts must break loudly at sign time, not
silently at notarize time weeks later.

Usage:
    generate-manifest.py <manifest-template.json> <path/to/App.app>

Reads S3 substitution values from env (SIGNER_ACCESS_ROLE_ARN, SIGNING_BUCKET,
INPUT_KEY, OUTPUT_KEY) and prints the final manifest JSON to stdout. A summary
line is printed to stderr for build logs.
