 * SIGTERM reaches the gateway's own handler, which flushes sessions, memory and
 * cron and reaps its kiro-cli / MCP / app-server children before exiting, and
 * SIGKILL is a genuinely stronger follow-up for a child that ignored it. Neither
 * holds on Windows: Node maps BOTH signal names onto TerminateProcess, so no
 * handler runs, nothing is flushed, and the SIGKILL step is unreachable because
 * the SIGTERM already hard-terminated the pid. What survives is every
 * DESCENDANT, reparented and still holding the data home's locks and the same
 * .local_secret — and because the port frees, the caller's verification reports
 * success while those orphans race the replacement gateway. Windows has no
 * process group a single kill can reach, so the tree kill (`taskkill /T /F`) is

 * delay, treating "signal accepted" as "process dead". That is wrong for a
 * gateway wedged in an uninterruptible kernel wait (macOS `U` state, e.g. a
 * blocking close() on a dead socket): SIGKILL is queued but never delivered, so
 * the process lives on and keeps the port. The caller then respawned into a
 * guaranteed "address already in use" and surfaced a confusing "exited code 1".
 *
 * This version polls the listener set after killing and returns `freed` based on
 * whether the port is ACTUALLY free afterwards (not merely whether our targets
 * died), plus `survivors` (the KiroCrew PIDs we tried to kill that are still
 * holding the port) and `foreignHolder` (a non-KiroCrew process still owns it).
 * `freed === false` means a respawn would just fail to bind — the caller MUST
 * NOT respawn; it should tell the user a restart is required (`survivors`, an
 * unkillable wedge) or that another app holds the port (`foreignHolder`).
 * With `failClosedOnProbeError`, an unavailable owner probe returns
 * `probeFailed:true, freed:false` instead of throwing or claiming the port is
 * free. Windows uses this because netstat failures must block a blind respawn.
 *
 * All side effects are injected so this is unit-testable without Electron or a
