# End-to-end macOS auto-update test via electron-updater (NO Apple notarization).
#
# Builds v1.0.0 (the "installed" app) and v1.0.1 (the "update"), signed with a
# deep-signs both, serves the 1.0.1 zip from a local yml feed, and prints how to
# run + what to observe. Proves the full loop: check -> CONSENT -> download ->
# graceful gateway stop -> bundle swap -> relaunch as 1.0.1.
#
# CAVEATS (read before running):
#  - Same-machine only. A throwaway SELF-SIGNED identity (not ad-hoc) satisfies Squirrel.Mac's
#    same-identity check for a locally-built, locally-run app. Gatekeeper
#    acceptance on a CLEAN machine still requires real notarization.
#  - CONSENT-FIRST: discovery never downloads (autoDownload=false), so this test
#    REQUIRES two human clicks in Settings > About: "Download", then
#    "Restart & Update". An unattended run will stop at "found" and look stuck —
#    that is the design working, not a hang.
#  - backend-dist: the packaged app resolves its gateway via find-bin.js, which
#    falls back to a PATH `kirocrew`. This script therefore stubs an EMPTY
#    backend-dist to satisfy electron-builder's extraResources (which errors on
#    a missing source dir) instead of building the ~500MB backend bundle.
#    Have `kirocrew` on PATH (toolbox install) so a gateway can start. We
#    isolate with a temp KIROCREW_HOME + the BETA flavor (port 7788) so this
#    never touches your real :7777 gateway.
#  - The feed is http://127.0.0.1 (loopback is exempt from App Transport
#    Security, and buildFeedBase permits http ONLY on loopback). If the updater
#    refuses the http feed, add to package.json build.mac:
#    "extendInfo": { "NSAppTransportSecurity": { "NSAllowsLocalNetworking": true } }
#
# Env overrides: PORT (8799), OUT (/tmp/kirocrew-ota), NODE (node).

# --- Signing identity -------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY NOT AD-HOC: Squirrel.Mac verifies that the DOWNLOADED bundle satisfies the
# RUNNING app's designated code requirement (SQRLCodeSignature). An ad-hoc
# signature has no signing identity, so its designated requirement degrades to
# the bundle's own cdhash -- which is by definition different for a different
# build. The update can therefore never satisfy it, and Squirrel refuses the
# install with:
#
#   Code signature at URL .../KiroCrew.app/ did not pass validation:
#   code failed to satisfy specified code requirement(s)
#   (domain: SQRLCodeSignatureErrorDomain, code: -1)
#
# Observed live in ota-test.yml run 30490303783. The previous note here claimed
# ad-hoc signatures satisfy Squirrel; that was never true and made this harness
# unable to prove the one thing it exists to prove.
#
# THE FIX: mint a throwaway self-signed CODE-SIGNING certificate in a temporary
# keychain and sign BOTH bundles with it. Same identity + same bundle ID => the
# update satisfies the running app's requirement, and the swap mechanism is
# exercised for real. Still no secrets and no Developer ID: this validates the
# SWAP, not Gatekeeper acceptance or notarization (those live in the signing
# lane). The keychain is deleted on exit.

  1. [update] feed: http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/feed/stable/
     [update] checking…
     [update] found $UPDATE_VER (running $INSTALLED_VER) — awaiting user consent
     ^ Discovery STOPS here by design: autoDownload=false. A native
       notification points at Settings > About. This is NOT a hang.

  2. >>> CLICK: open Settings > About, press "Download".
     [update] user consented — downloading $UPDATE_VER
     (download-progress events drive the percentage in the card)
     [update] downloaded $UPDATE_VER — notifying UI

  3. >>> CLICK: press "Restart & Update".
     [update] stopping gateway before install
     [update] gateway down — quitAndInstall
     -> bundle swap -> app relaunches as $UPDATE_VER

  4. Verify the swap actually happened (do NOT accept "no error" as success):
       defaults read "$INST_APP/Contents/Info" CFBundleShortVersionString
       # must print $UPDATE_VER
     Re-open the app: [update] up to date
