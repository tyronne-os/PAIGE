// Migration of the per-user electron-store directory across the npm `name`
// rename ("kirocrew-electron-mac" -> "kirocrew-desktop" / "-nightly").
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Electron derives userData from the npm package name, so renaming
// it repoints electron-store at a brand-new directory and every setting in the old
// one is silently orphaned. Observed on a machine that took the nightly rename:
// %APPDATA%\kirocrew-electron-mac\config.json still held
//
//     "updateChannel": "stable",  "windowState": {...},  "themeAccent": "#8e48ff"
//
// while the freshly created kirocrew-desktop-nightly\config.json had
// `updateChannel: ""` and default geometry.
//
// The worst loss is updateChannel, because it is the stable<->insider switcher and
// resolveChannel() treats an unset preference as STABLE. An insider user whose
// preference is orphaned is migrated onto the stable feed with no consent and no
// message -- the exact outcome resolveChannel's contract calls out as the thing a
// channel decision must never do implicitly.
//
// HOW IT AVOIDS OVERWRITING ANYTHING. The migration SEEDS the destination
// config.json before electron-store opens it, and only ever when that file does not
// exist. That single condition carries the whole state machine, which is why there
// is no marker, no pending flag and no "is this store fresh?" verdict to get wrong:
//
//   file absent    -> there is nothing to overwrite, by definition
//   seeding throws -> file stays absent -> the next launch retries identically
//   seeding works  -> file exists       -> never eligible again
