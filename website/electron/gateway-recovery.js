// PROBLEM: the post-handoff liveness monitor fires onUnresponsive whenever
// /api/status stops answering. main.js used to react ONE way — assume a wedged
// local backend and force-kill the port + respawn. That is correct only when WE
// spawned the gateway. On the reuse path the port-holder is someone else's
// process, and in the remote-tunnel setup (localhost:<port> is an SSH forward to
// a remote gateway) an unresponsive probe almost always means the SSH tunnel
// dropped (lid close, Wi-Fi<->Ethernet handoff, VPN blip), not a wedged backend.
// Killing the port would tear down the tunnel; the old code then fell through to
// a terminal error dialog that QUIT the app on any button — including Retry (the
// perceived "crash on Retry" on network change).
//
// This helper is the single source of truth for that fork: given how the
// gateway was obtained (the launcher's single ownership state), return which
// recovery strategy to run. Keeping it pure means the ownership rule is covered
// by tests independently of the Electron plumbing.

// The launcher's gateway-ownership vocabulary (main.js keeps exactly one of
// these in a single module-level state; see GATEWAY_OWNERSHIP_STATES):
//   "none"           — no gateway yet, or an adopted holder that could NOT be
//                      positively identified as local (tunnel / external).
//   "spawned"        — this app spawned the bundled backend on this port.
//   "reused-local"   — adopted a local same-family Kiro Crew process.
//   "reused-service" — like reused-local, but the holder was SERVICE-classified.
