 * Ops Mission Control e2e — browser-side verification that the app EXISTS,
 * LOADS, and every mode WORKS.
 *
 * Why this exists: the app is `defaultEnabled: false`, so it is invisible in the
 * nav until enabled, and the whole surface (board, settings, dispatch) sits behind
 * a `_require_enabled` gate that 403s while disabled. Both are correct behavior
 * and both look identical to "the app is missing" from the outside — the failure
 * this suite is here to tell apart.
 *
 * These tests MUTATE gateway state (they enable the app and write provider
 * config). That is deliberate: enabling is the thing under test. They are written
 * to be idempotent so a re-run against an already-enabled gateway still passes.
 *
 * Run against a live gateway:
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:6777 \
 *   PLAYWRIGHT_TOKEN=$(kirocrew token --port 6777 | sed "s/.*token=//") \
 *   npx playwright test playwright/ops-mission-control.spec.ts --project=chromium

  // The collapse handling is the subtle part. Once a seeded incident widens the board, the
  // control drops to a single trigger + a chevron dropdown, and the segment `title`s do not
  // exist in the DOM until that dropdown is OPEN. The earlier version opened the chevron and
  // immediately clicked, racing the dropdown's mount animation; under a wider board it timed
  // out. Now: if the segment is not already visible, open the chevron and WAIT for the segment
  // to appear before clicking. This coupled every tab-switching spec to how many incidents an
  // earlier spec had left on the board, since the specs share one gateway under CI's
  // `workers: 1`.
  // `SegmentedControl` has THREE responsive modes: `full` and `compact` both render one
  // title'd button per segment (compact just hides the label text), while `dropdown` shows a
  // single trigger + chevron and mounts the segment buttons only when opened. Scoped to
  // `getByTitle` so the app sidebar's own like-named buttons never match.
  //
  // The subtlety that made this flake is that the mode is decided ASYNCHRONOUSLY. The control
  // mounts in `full` (title'd buttons present, no chevron), then a `useEffect` + `ResizeObserver`
  // measures the parent and may flip to `dropdown` (title'd buttons unmounted, chevron mounted).
  // A seeded incident widens the board and drives that flip, and the observer can fire several
  // times as layout settles, so the two forms briefly co-exist or briefly BOTH vanish for a
  // frame. The previous helper sampled `getByTitle(...).count()` ONCE and branched irrevocably:
  // if it happened to sample during that settling window it read 0, took the chevron path, and
  // then waited 10s for a chevron that the settled `full`-mode control does not have — the
  // deterministic timeout seen on `:532`/`:797` under the shared, board-widened gateway.
  //
  // Fix: never decide from a single sample. Wait for the control to reach a STABLE actionable
  // state (either the title'd segment is attached, or the dropdown trigger is), then act on
  // whichever it settled into — re-checking after opening the dropdown so a late flip back to
