# KiroCrew Website

React + TypeScript + Vite single-page app for the Kiro Crew dashboard. Built assets
are emitted to `dist/` and copied into the Python package at
`../src/kiro_crew/static/dist/` so the gateway can serve them.

## Develop

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies (public npm registry)
npm run dev          # Vite dev server on http://localhost:3000 (proxies API to the gateway on :5476)
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build        # tsc -b && vite build  → dist/
```

After building, stage `dist/` into the backend package so the gateway serves it.
Clear the destination first: Vite emits content-hashed filenames, so copying over an
existing bundle accumulates stale assets.

```bash
rm -rf ../src/kiro_crew/static/dist && cp -r dist ../src/kiro_crew/static/dist
```

## Test and lint

```bash
npx tsc -b           # the real type check
npm run lint         # eslint
npm run test         # website vitest suite + the Electron suite (a jscpd pretest runs first)
```

`npm run typecheck` runs `tsc -b`, the same build-mode check as `npm run build` and
CI. Build mode is what follows the root `tsconfig.json`'s project references; a plain
`tsc --noEmit` there compiles an empty program and passes unconditionally.
