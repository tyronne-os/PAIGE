// ── Boot-critical module retry ──────────────────────────────────────
// Nothing is cached here — the immutable HTTP cache owns hashed assets, and the
// /vendor stubs have stable filenames. What this adds is a bounded retry, because
// one 502 on a module a document imports is not a degraded page, it is a dead
// one.
//
// A page load asks for the entire module graph at once, and the hop in front of
// the gateway has a lower real concurrency ceiling than it advertises:
// `tailscale serve` announces 250 concurrent HTTP/2 streams and starts answering
// 502 past roughly 140. Measured against a Windows gateway on one connection —
// 120 streams: 120 OK; 200 streams: 140 OK + 60x502; 247 streams: 143 OK +
// 104x502. The 502s land on module scripts, so the shell paints its dark skeleton
// and the app never boots. On a phone that reads as a black screen that no reload
// clears, because the navigation keeps being served from the shell cache above
// while the modules keep failing.
//
// The failure is capacity-shaped, so the backoff is JITTERED — retrying a whole
// failed wave on one tick just rebuilds the burst that caused it. Only 5xx and
// network errors are retried: a 404 means the asset is genuinely gone (a stale
// shell pointing at a pruned build) and must surface at once instead of costing
// three round trips. Safe to re-issue `request` without cloning because the fetch
// handler already returned for every non-GET, and a GET carries no body to
// consume.
