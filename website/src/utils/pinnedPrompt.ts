/**
 * Geometry + selection helpers for the pinned-prompt banner (the most recent
 * user prompt that has scrolled fully behind the chat fold, shown as a sticky
 * band under the session title).
 *
 * The hand-off is **bottom-edge driven**: a prompt scrolls with the transcript
 * until its bubble's BOTTOM edge reaches the bottom of the banner band, i.e.
 * until the row is entirely hidden behind the band; only then does it collapse
 * into the banner. It is then pushed out by the NEXT prompt as that prompt's top
 * border meets it (`computePinPush`) — a separate, earlier line, so a tall prompt
 * shows no banner at all while it is being read.
 *
 * Why the bottom edge and not the top (the original sticky-style rule): a prompt
 * taller than the band — an essay, a pasted stack trace — satisfies "top has
 * reached the fold" the instant it is sent, so it would collapse into a one-line
 * banner before the user could read it, and its still-laid-out (but hidden) row
 * left a prompt-sized hole above the response. Tracking the bottom edge means a
 * tall prompt stays fully readable and scrolls away line by line. For a
 * one-line prompt the two rules fire on the same pixel (its bubble height equals
 * the collapsed card height), so short-prompt behaviour is unchanged.
 *
 * The banner cannot be a real sticky element because the transcript is
 * virtualized — a row scrolled far above the window unmounts, so the sticky node
 * would vanish. Instead the banner is an overlay driven by the same math.

 * the FIRST prompt of that consecutive run — the walk finds the top of the
 * contextual block the target belongs to.
 *
 * Why not land on `target` directly: putting it at the jump chrome leaves the
 * prompt above it straddling the hand-off line — it cannot pin (its bottom is
 * still below the line) while its own top edge has already pushed the fallback
 * banner fully out — so the banner unmounts and the jump chain dies on a
 * landing the scan treats as a transient. Anchoring at the head of the run
 * puts a non-prompt row (or the top of the list) on the line instead, so the
 * previous turn's banner survives and the chain continues.
 *
 * The walk consumes only rows `isPrompt` admits — consecutive USER prompts (a
 * double-send, a prompt typed while the previous one was still queued). Machine
 * openers (nudge and subagent rows) are not prompts here, so a run of them above
 * the target is an ordinary non-prompt gap and the walk stops at the target: the
 * previous user prompt's banner then survives the landing exactly as it would
 * over any other reply row. The walk used to consume machine runs so a jump
 * never landed "between two machine rows with the context that explains them
 * still hidden above"; that concern went away with the rows themselves — a
 * nudge is now a one-line self-labelled system row and a subagent completion a
 * self-labelled headline card, so a landing beside either reads on its own, and
 * the banner above it names the user prompt the whole block answers.
 *
 * Walking up lengthens the jump. The virtualizer's near/far decision
 * (`mountIndex` in useVirtualChat) compares the anchor's jump window against
 * the COMMITTED window with `NEAR_JUMP_OVERSCAN_MULT` overscan windows of
 * slack (24 rows for the transcript, which passes `overscan: 6`) — a budget
 * shared with the distance the jump already covers, so the walk consumes
 * whatever slack a near jump has left over. In the common case (the pinned
 * prompt is the previous turn) that leaves the glide untouched; a jump
 * already sitting at the band's edge can be tipped onto the far path by the
 * walk, and that is the right outcome there — the gap is unmounted spacer,
 * and a glide across it would scrub blank.

 * How far (px) to translate the banner UP so the incoming prompt pushes it out.

 * bottom (`gap === ROW_PAD_Y + bannerH`, the card's own bottom, since the card
 * sits ROW_PAD_Y below the fold) and completes when it reaches the fold
 * (`gap === 0`), by which point the card is entirely above the fold.
 *
 * The travel is therefore `ROW_PAD_Y + bannerH`, NOT `bannerH`: the card starts
 * ROW_PAD_Y below the fold, so a `bannerH` travel strands its last ROW_PAD_Y of

 * two lines separated for tall prompts it became a 4px strip of the outgoing
 * bubble's bottom edge parked over the incoming prompt for the whole no-banner
 * stretch — flickering in size with every sub-pixel scroll.
 *
 * Note this is a DIFFERENT line from the one that decides which prompt is pinned
 * (`pinHandoffY`, driven by the incoming prompt's BOTTOM edge), and deliberately
 * so. For a prompt taller than the band the two separate: the card is fully
 * pushed out while the prompt's top is still rising, and the prompt only takes
 * the pin later, once its bottom clears the band. The stretch between them —
 * where no banner is shown at all while the tall prompt is read — is intended:
 * the band would otherwise slide up across the prompt's own text, since by then
 * the only part of it beside the band is its last line. For a one-line prompt the
