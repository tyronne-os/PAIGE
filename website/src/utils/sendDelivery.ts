 * same as an explicit refusal: the user was told the send failed and handed the
 * payload back to retry, which duplicates a turn that did go out — side effects
 * included. The status line is the one piece of a mangled response that survives,
 * so it decides that case:
 *
 *   - a NON-2XX status is a refusal in its own right, body or no body (an aiohttp
 *     500 answers in HTML, and a proxy's 502 page is not JSON either), which is
 *     what these paths have always reported for it;
 *   - a 2XX whose body will not parse proves only that the request was accepted.
 *     That is `unknown`, and an unknown must never be reported as a refusal.
 *
 * A JSON body that is not an object (`null`, an array, a bare string) is treated
 * as unreadable rather than as a receipt with absent flags — reading acceptance
 * flags off an array would call a 200 a refusal for the same wrong reason.

/** Did `POST /api/chat` actually take custody of this message, as the row the

 *
 *  Only an IMMEDIATE dispatch counts. `queued` is deliberately excluded, and not
 *  as a conservative default -- it is the wrong question. Two properties of the
 *  busy branch make a queued response unusable as a receipt for THIS bubble:
 *
 *  - It queues only a NON-EMPTY message (`if message: slot.queue_append(...)`)
 *    yet answers `{ok: true, queued: true}` either way, so a file-only send that
 *    races into it is dropped behind a success-shaped body.
 *  - When it does queue, it broadcasts `queue_push`, and that card is the
 *    server-owned representation of the message. The optimistic bubble is then a
 *    duplicate whose fate is not the row's: cancelling the queued message removes
 *    the card and leaves the bubble behind.
 *
 *  In both shapes "confirmed" would be a lie about a message that never ran, so
 *  a queued acceptance leaves the bubble pending and the 30s indicator keeps its
 *  say. This costs nothing in the ordinary case: a send made while the slot is
 *  visibly busy appends no optimistic bubble at all, so there is nothing to
 *  confirm -- only the client-thought-idle race reaches here, and that is exactly
 *  the case worth warning about.
