/** WebKit-only page-zoom suppression for the touch shell.
 *
 *  Why this file exists at all: the viewport meta in `index.html` and the root
 *  `touch-action` in `index.css` are the other two mechanisms, and neither reaches
 *  iOS. WebKit has deliberately ignored the viewport zoom keys **for user gestures**
 *  since iOS 10 (an accessibility decision), and it does not treat `touch-action` as
 *  governing page zoom either. What it does expose is the non-standard Safari gesture
 *  events, and cancelling `gesturestart` is the one path that stops a two-finger pinch
 *  from scaling the whole shell.
 *
 *  Cancelling the gesture events does NOT suppress touch or pointer events, so a
 *  surface that owns its own pinch keeps working — the image viewer scales its own
 *  transform off two pointers (see Lightbox in `MarkdownRenderer.tsx`) and is
 *  unaffected by anything here.
 *
 *  Scoped to coarse pointers. Desktop Safari raises the same events for a trackpad
 *  pinch, where zooming a page is a convention this has no business taking away.
 *
 *  For the policy and the accessibility trade behind it, see the page-zoom section of
 *  `website/docs/narrow-viewport.md` — the authoritative copy.
