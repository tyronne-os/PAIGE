/**
 * Cross-window coordination for popped-out artifacts.
 *
 * A "pop out" opens an artifact in a dedicated same-origin browser window at
 * `/popout/artifact/:slug`. Unlike chat sessions (whose slot key isn't
 * URL-safe, so it rides in `?sid=`), an artifact's slug IS its URL identity, so
 * it's the route param directly. The generic coordination engine lives in
 * `popoutController`; this module specializes it for artifacts: a distinct
 * BroadcastChannel (no cross-talk with chat popouts), the `/popout/artifact/…`
 * URL, the window name, and the `/artifacts/<slug>` main-view fallback for
 * `returnSelfToMain`. Pure helpers are re-exported for unit tests.
