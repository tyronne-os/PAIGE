/**
 * Preview flags — local, per-device opt-ins for surfaces that ship in the
 * bundle but are NOT ready to be released.
 *
 * The problem this solves: a surface can be code-complete enough to merge and
 * still be too rough to put in front of every user. Deleting it to hold the
 * release loses the work and the review history; shipping it visible releases
 * an unpolished page. A preview flag keeps the code on `main`, keeps the route
 * routable, and simply does not advertise the surface anywhere in the UI until
 * the operator turns it on from Settings > Developer > Feature Previews.
 *
 * Deliberately localStorage, not backend config: this is a per-device "show me
 * the unfinished thing" switch with no server behavior attached (the surface's
 * own API is unaffected either way), which is exactly the shape of the existing
 * Developer Mode gate (`mc-dev-mode`). Putting it in `config.json` would imply
 * a fleet-wide setting and a backend contract that does not exist.
 *
 * Retiring a flag is the goal, not an afterthought: when the surface is
 * polished, delete its `previewFlag` from the registry entry and its card from
 * Settings > Developer > Feature Previews. The stale localStorage key then reads as an
 * ordinary unused key and no longer gates anything. The card's "See what it
 * looks like" intro goes with it: its builder in `FeaturePreviewsSection.tsx`,
 * its captures under `public/app-assets/feature-previews/`, its
 * `pages.developer.featurePreviewsTab.intro.*` keys in every catalog, and its
 * `shoot` step in `scripts/capture-feature-previews.mjs` — the media is the
 * heaviest thing a flag ships, so it must not outlive the flag.

 * two unrelated meanings here: `PREVIEW_CREW` holds Crew Mode (parallel
 * sub-sessions) and the Crew Members page, while this holds sessions dispatched
 * to another MACHINE over the instances tunnel. Sharing one key would release or
 * hold both at once, which is the same half-ship failure `PREVIEW_CREW`'s own
 * one-flag-two-doors reasoning exists to prevent — in the opposite direction.
 *
 * Held because the LANDING is unfinished, not the dispatch: the session really is
 * created on the peer, but there is no native remote chat view yet, so it opens
 * by switching to that crew's pane, and the local session list does not show
 * live remote sessions — so the session is hard to return to afterwards.
 *
 * Its toggle lives in Settings > Developer > Feature Previews, alongside every other
 * unreleased surface, and NOT on Settings > Remote Instances where it started: a
 * held feature is found by looking at the one page that lists held features, so
 * scattering an opt-in onto the page it happens to act on hides it from the only
 * reader who wants it. It keeps its own card there rather than sharing
 * {@link PREVIEW_CREW}'s, for the two-meanings reason above.
 *
 * Gating the INGRESS only. A session already created on a peer keeps running
 * there and stays reachable through that crew's own dashboard; turning the flag
 * off only stops offering the menu entry.
