 *  eats exactly the hard break this exists to protect — `"line  \n"` came out as

 * appended twice. A synchronously rejected create can land before React flushes
 * the composer clear, so the payload may already be sitting there.
 *
 * Deduped ONLY on exact equality. A whitespace-delimited occurrence is not proof
 * the payload was already restored — a draft like "please run tests first"
 * contains the distinct payload "run tests" — and treating it as restored drops
 * the message. Equality still covers the case this guard exists for, and errs
 * toward a visible duplicate rather than silent loss.
 *
 * One implementation for every recovery site — ChatPage's failed create and its
 * failed send, and ChatPane's own restore, which serves both a failed send and a
 * failed question-card fallback — for the same reason `mergeIntoDraft` is
 * shared: separate spellings of one rule are how the surfaces drift apart.
