/**
 * Central error journal + "ask the agent about this error" hand-off channel.
 *
 * ## Why a journal instead of a prop
 *
 * Error text is rendered ad-hoc in ~80 files (`setError(e.message)` into a local
 * red `<div>`), so the *string* is everywhere but the *context* — HTTP status,
 * failing endpoint, the backend's machine-readable `code` — is thrown away at
 * the call site. Threading a structured error object through 80 components is a
 * migration; recording it once at the transport is not.
 *
 * `api/client.ts`'s `j`/`jNullable` are the single chokepoint every dashboard
 * API error flows through, so they record here. A UI that only has the message
 * string can then call {@link findReport} to recover the full context by exact
 * message match, which is what lets a shared error banner offer a
 * context-carrying "ask the agent" button with **zero** changes at the call
 * site.
 *
 * ## Redaction
 *
 * The report is fed to an LLM prompt, so it must not carry credentials:
 *  - the recorded endpoint is **path-only** — a `?token=…` query string (the
 *    dashboard's own auth hand-off shape) is dropped, never journaled;
 *  - free-form text (response bodies, component stacks) goes through
 *    {@link redactSecrets} before it is stored.
 *
 * Nothing here imports React or the store, so the transport can record without
 * pulling the UI graph into `api/client.ts`.
