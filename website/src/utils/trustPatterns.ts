/**
 * Trust-grant pattern helpers — the single source of truth for how a trust
 * click is turned into a `pattern` string.
 *
 * Why this is a module and not three inline expressions: the `pattern` sent with
 * `trust_command` / `trust_base` is what decides HOW MUCH a grant widens. Any
 * surface that offers tiered trust (the dashboard's `TrustDropdown`, and any
 * embedded/companion approval UI) has to produce byte-identical patterns for the
 * same click. Two independent copies can drift silently — the button label stays
 * the same while the granted scope changes — so the transform lives here and is
 * imported, never re-derived.
 *
 * Inputs arrive already computed and redacted by the gateway (see chat_runner's
 * `_extract_full_command` / `_extract_base_command`); these functions only shape
 * them for the slot-approve endpoint.
 */

 * Turn the gateway's comma-joined base list into the glob pattern that trusts

/**
 * Shorten a command for a BUTTON LABEL only — never for the pattern itself.
 * Truncating a pattern would change the grant; this is display only.
 *
 * Elides the MIDDLE rather than the tail, which is what actually removes the
 * collision class. Commands that differ usually differ at the END — a filename,
 * a trailing path segment, a flag value — while sharing a long head
 * (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/…`). Cutting the tail is therefore
 * precisely what makes two different commands render identically, and raising the
 * budget alone would only move that cliff: a longer `owner/repo` pushes the
 * distinguishing filename past any fixed head budget.
 *
 * Keeping the tail also matters on touch, where the `title` tooltip callers
 * attach never fires, so the label is the whole basis for an exact-string grant.
 *
 * This is the ONLY implementation. Every surface (the dashboard's TrustDropdown,
 * mochi's approval card via its `src/shared/trustPatterns.ts` re-export) imports
 * it from here — a second copy is how a budget or algorithm change lands on one
 * surface and not the other, which is this same defect in a new place.
