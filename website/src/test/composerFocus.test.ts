/**
 * Composer focus after creating a session.
 *
 * The bug this locks: there is exactly ONE composer element and it is bound to
 * whichever slot is ACTIVE. Focusing it while `createSlot` is still in flight
 * puts the caret on the OLD session, so anything typed in that window becomes
 * the old slot's draft and is lost when the new slot activates. The collapsed
 * sidebar's flyout originally dispatched and focused on the next frame without
 * waiting, which is that window.
 *
 * Locks the contract:
 *  (1) `focusComposerAfter` does NOT focus before the promise fulfils.
 *  (2) It focuses after fulfilment.
 *  (3) A rejected create focuses nothing and produces no unhandled rejection.
 *  (4) Touch devices are skipped — focusing raises the on-screen keyboard over
 *      the thing the user just made.
 *  (5) The composer is found by the stable `data-composer-input` attribute,
 *      NEVER by its aria-label: the label is translated in all twelve catalogs,
 *      so a label-based lookup matches in English only and silently no-ops for
 *      every other locale.
