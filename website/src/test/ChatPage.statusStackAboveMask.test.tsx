/**
 * The yellow "N sub-agent results ready" bar rendered with its top border, both
 * top corners and the first line's ascenders shaved off — it read as the card
 * being clipped by the UI.
 *
 * Nothing clipped it. The transcript's bottom mask is `relative z-[1]` and
 * deliberately overshoots COMPOSER_MASK_OVERSHOOT_PX BELOW the scrollport edge so
 * it ends flush against the composer box. That overshoot is sized for the distance
 * ChatInput owns (`pt-1` + the `h-[6px]` spacer) — a distance that only holds while
 * the composer status stack is EMPTY. With a bar present the bar occupies that
 * strip, and the mask's tail (opaque: `from-bg from-[62%]` makes the bottom 62%
 * solid, and the overshoot is entirely inside it) painted OVER the bar's top 10px.
 * Measured in an isolated repro of the same column: mask.bottom − bar.top == 10,
 * exactly the overshoot, and lifting the bar changed pixels while leaving every
 * rect identical — paint order, not layout.
 *
 * SubagentProgressBar was immune only by accident: its wave chip already sits at
 * `z-[46]` for an unrelated reason (clearing theme-experience overlays), which is
 * why the defect only surfaced on the bars that had no z-index at all.
 *
 * The fix is per-child rather than one z-index on the stack wrapper on purpose: a
 * z-index there would make the wrapper a stacking context and CONFINE the wave
 * chip's 46, re-exposing it to the overlays it was lifted to clear. So this file
 * pins three things — the ordering, the wrapper staying context-free, and the
 * child LIST, so a sixth bar cannot quietly inherit the bug.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT, as the two neighbouring mask guards already are:
 * the numbers live in five files, several as Tailwind classes jsdom cannot resolve
 * into a paint order, and the invariant is the comparison BETWEEN them.
