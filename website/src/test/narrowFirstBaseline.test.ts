/**
 * Every source file under `src/`, read ONCE and shared by the assertions below.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing, and both were measured on this tree (1285
 * files):
 *
 *  1. **Read once, not once per test.** Each assertion below used to walk and
 *     read the whole tree itself, so it was read four times over plus a fifth
 *     pass for `src/apps`.
 *  2. **Reads are CONCURRENT.** `for (const f of files) await readFile(f)` takes
 *     **12.7s** here even with a warm page cache, while the same reads issued
 *     together take **209ms** — a 60x gap, because the cost is per-file I/O
 *     latency rather than throughput, and awaiting in a loop serializes it. That
 *     serialization is what pushed these tests past the 15s per-test budget on a
 *     Windows checkout, where per-file latency is higher: they failed for every
 *     Windows contributor while passing on CI's Linux runner.
 *
 * Contents are normalized to LF because these assertions match multi-line shapes
 * and split on '\n', which a CRLF checkout would otherwise break independently
 * of the timing.
 *
 * A module-level promise rather than a `beforeAll`, so the work happens once per
 * FILE and every test simply awaits the same result.
