/**
 * Telemetry panel: the fault-rate tile must not report a real failure as zero.
 *
 * Measured against the real row store, the turn histogram carried
 * `{ok: 498, error: 1}` — `fault_rate` 0.002. The tile rendered that as a bold
 * `0%` in `--ok` green, directly above a sub line reading "1 faults / 499
 * turns". Two independent defects produced it:
 *
 *  1. `Math.round(0.002 * 100)` is 0, so every fault rate under 0.5% collapsed
 *     to a clean zero — the same rounding lie that made a 0.4% spend share read
 *     as `0%` in the credits tables.
 *  2. The colour branch was `faultPct < 2 → --ok`, keyed on the ROUNDED
 *     percentage rather than on whether any fault exists, so a window with real
 *     failures was painted in the success colour.
 *
 * A third defect was latent rather than visible: the fault COUNT summed only
 * `error` + `timeout`, while the API derives `fault_rate` from every outcome
 * that is not `ok`. Any other value — including the `unknown` that shards
 * predating the outcome attribute aggregate under — was excluded from the
 * count but included in the rate, so the tile showed a rate over one
 * population beside a count over another.
 *
 * These are display-layer defects only. Both underlying instruments are
 * fail-closed and were measured to be honest: `_turn_outcome` maps a real
 * `stop_reason`, and both startup emit paths default to `error` and overwrite
 * with `ready` only on the success path — so the 100% ready rate is a genuine
 * 1411/1411, not a tautology.
