/**
 * BOTH artifact library tables render LibraryTableHead (for the header) and
 * ArtifactRow (for a data row), so the Actions column is defined once and shared.
 * It is an AUTO-layout table whose declared column widths total past a phone
 * (and a rail-narrowed desktop pane), so Actions — the last column — starts past
 * the scroll edge at rest and every open/delete costs a horizontal scroll. The
 * fix pins the Actions cells (header + body) `sticky right-0` on an opaque
 * background, with a seam (1px child div + `right-full` fade) gated on the
 * MEASURED overflow flag (`edgeRight`) — same treatment as the hooks and
 * schedule tables, adapted for auto layout where a wrapper-anchored cue cannot
 * know the pinned column's left edge.
 *
 * The seam is a CHILD DIV and not `border-l`: under Preflight's
 * `border-collapse: collapse` a cell border belongs to the collapsed table grid
 * and paints at the cell's layout slot, so it stays behind while the sticky cell
 * travels.
 *
 * Load-bearing parts a later edit could lose separately:
 * 1. `sticky right-0` + `bg-card` on BOTH cells (transparent cells show the
 *    scrolling columns through the pin).
 * 2. The width contract on the header (`w-[120px]`, counted by the min-width).
 * 3. The overflow gate on the seam (a permanent seam lies on a table that fits).
 * 4. The row-state overlay: it mirrors `.table-striped`'s zebra via the
 *    ancestor `nth-child(even)` variant (the row's REAL DOM position, not a
 *    clean map index, because folder/artifact/lane rows interleave), and layers
 *    the drag-file highlight and hover tint on top — losing it makes the pinned
 *    cell ignore zebra/hover/drag while the rest of the row paints.
 * 5. The observed content node: auto layout means the rows set scrollWidth,
 *    which a ResizeObserver on the scroller's own box never reports, so the
 *    hook must observe the table's border-box directly (both consumers).
 *
 * Comments are stripped before matching — the rationale in the source quotes the
 * class names being asserted.
 *
 * The asserted markup lives in `components/library/LibraryTable.tsx`, not in the
 * page: both tables were lifted out of ArtifactsPage so a second library-shaped
 * surface (the AWS Control cloud drive) renders the same table instead of a copy
 * of it. The property this file pins is unchanged — only its address moved.
