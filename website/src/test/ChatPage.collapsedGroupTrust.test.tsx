/**
 * Source contract for #5434: ChatPage's CollapsibleToolGroup mounts must not
 * declare the standing-trust tier.
 *
 * Both mounts resolve approvals through the shared `toApiDecision`
 * (`utils/approvalDecision.ts`, single-sourced by #8193 — ChatPage held its own
 * copy until then) into the one-shot `api.resolveApproval` endpoint, which has no
 * trust verb. The group component is fail-closed (`canTrust` opt-in), so the
 * regression this pins is someone flipping `canTrust` on a ChatPage mount: the
 * Trust button would render, and because that mapping is fail-closed
 * (`'approved' -> approve`, else `reject`), a user's Trust click would resolve as
 * a SILENT DENIAL — worse than the silent one-shot approve #5434 removed.
 *
 * Why a source contract and not a render test: these mounts are currently
 * unreachable — `groupDisplayItems` skips `permission` rows entirely (the
 * pinned ApprovalBar owns them) and nothing else is GROUPABLE, so no transcript
 * can mount the group from ChatPage. That latency is exactly why the defect had
 * to be fixed by inspection (#5434), and why the pin must read the source
 * rather than the DOM. The component's own rendering of the decision set is
 * covered behaviorally in CollapsibleToolGroupCov80.test.tsx; the app-sdk
 * threading in ChatMessageList.test.tsx and ChatEmbed.test.tsx.
