/**
 * The chrome hides on the way down and comes back on the way up.
 *
 * The settle-window assertion is the load-bearing one. Collapsing the chrome
 * GROWS the gallery scroller's clientHeight, which lowers its maximum
 * scrollTop; near the bottom the browser then clamps scrollTop downward to fit.
 * That clamp arrives as a scroll event with a negative delta — identical in
 * shape to the reader swiping up — so without the window it re-expands the
 * chrome, which shrinks the scroller, which lets scrollTop grow again. The
 * result is a header that flickers exactly when the list is longest.
 *
 * `performance.now` is stubbed rather than advanced with fake timers because the
 * window is compared against it directly; controlling it makes the boundary
 * exact instead of dependent on how a timer mock rounds.
