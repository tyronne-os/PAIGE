/**
 * The diff views' split-view buttons: each button's ACTIVE styling must track
 * the state it toggles.
 *
 * The active class (`text-accent bg-accent-subtle`) is gated on the plain state,
 * not its negation, so the button lights up in split mode and dims in unified
 * mode — matching the sibling toggles beside it. Gating on the negation would
 * invert the highlight.
 *
 * This is a class-string inversion, so neither tsc nor a render assertion on
 * the toggle's behaviour would catch a regression. Assert on the source.
 *
 * SidePanel (the Turn Diff tab) owns a Pierre diff with its own split BUTTON, so
 * the class-string gate below is the only thing that can catch an inversion
 * there. MarkdownPanel's equivalent moved into the ⋯ menu as a checkbox row —
 * its state is `aria-checked`, which a render assertion can read directly, so
 * that half lives in MarkdownPanelCoverage.test.tsx instead.
