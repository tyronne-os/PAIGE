/**
 * REGRESSION GUARD — with nothing running, an automatic pin must not move a
 * reader who has scrolled up.
 *
 * Reported from a phone: scrolling up a bit over a hundred pixels sprang the
 * transcript back to the bottom even with no turn in flight. Every automatic pin
 * is gated on `stick`, and `stick` is meant to be released by a scroll-up — but
 * that leaves the whole guarantee resting on one event's bookkeeping, and a
 * geometry commit landing at the wrong moment (a height settle, a viewport
 * resize, an iOS momentum tail) can find follow still armed.
 *
 * `runActive` removes the class rather than one path: follow means "keep me at
 * the end of a LIVE turn", so idle + above the bottom releases follow instead of
 * pinning. Explicit intent — slot entry, the jump-to-bottom pill, sending — goes
 * through `forcePin` and is deliberately unaffected.
