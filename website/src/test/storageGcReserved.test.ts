/**
 * The startup localStorage sweep must not eat the gallery's height cache.
 *
 * The virtualizer partitions measured heights by `sessionId`, so a caller that
 * is not a chat session still has to name a partition. The sweep reads whatever
 * follows `vc_heights_` as a session id and deletes it when no live session
 * matches — which would wipe the gallery's partition on every boot. That failure
 * is silent: the cache still works within one page load, so heights simply never
 * stay warm, and the symptom (cards correcting their height on a first scroll,
 * every single visit) looks like the cache not working rather than like a sweep.
