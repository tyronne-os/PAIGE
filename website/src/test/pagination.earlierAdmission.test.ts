/**
 * THE admission rule for automatic older-history fetches: the control that offers
 * history must be on the reader's screen.
 *
 * Adopted after several automatic triggers were each found to page history on
 * something that was not the reader asking, all reproduced on a real phone:
 *
 *   - the top sentinel's geometry branch, firing on a transient produced by the
 *     per-keystroke re-render the composer's ChatPage-state text causes;
 *   - the window-start crossing, walked down across its lead by the soft keyboard
 *     CLOSING, which grows the viewport by its whole height so the window extends
 *     upward with nobody travelling.
 *
 * Each proxy had a second cause. The control's visibility does not, and it also
 * subsumes the short-transcript special case: a transcript too short to scroll
 * shows the control without anyone scrolling.
