/**
 * The OTHER two mobile panels ride the same compositor machinery as the
 * sessions drawer — pinned as SOURCE contracts, the way App.test.tsx pins the
 * drawer's own wrapper: these are pairings ("compositor slide" ⟷ "no framer
 * transform / no projection under it"), and one half regressing alone
 * reintroduces a bug the other half was built around.
 *
 *  LEFT (App.tsx mobile nav drawer):
 *   - the panel is a plain <nav> whose slide runs via animateDrawer — framer
 *     must not own a competing transform on it;
 *   - NavItem drops `layout` on mobile: a projection node under a
 *     compositor-driven ancestor compounds a corrective offset (the ChatSidebar
 *     rows measured >4,000px of it);
 *   - the scrim's opacity is animated in lockstep by animateDrawer, not by a
 *     framer fade of its own.
 *
 *  RIGHT (ChatPage inline side panel on mobile):
 *   - the mobile branch must NEVER animate `width` — a layout animation the
 *     compositor cannot take, which re-laid-out the squeezed chat pane every
 *     frame (the original 400ms width reveal);
 *   - it slides as a fixed overlay via sideOverlayX / animateDrawer;
 *   - keep-alive survives: a closed-but-alive panel stays mounted display:none
 *     so a live app tab's iframe is not torn down by the overlay conversion.
