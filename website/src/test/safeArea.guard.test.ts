/**
 * Safe-area regression guard.
 *
 * The dashboard is a PWA (`manifest.json` -> display: standalone) whose viewport
 * declares `viewport-fit=cover`, so on a notched iPhone the web view spans the
 * ENTIRE screen — under the Dynamic Island and under the home indicator. The app
 * shell insets its in-flow content once via `p-safe`, but `position: fixed`
 * elements are positioned against the viewport and escape that padding
 * completely. Each one has to inset itself.
 *
 * Nothing else in the toolchain can catch a regression here: a missing inset is
 * not a type error, not a lint error, and renders perfectly on every desktop and
 * in jsdom (where `env(safe-area-inset-*)` is 0). It is only visible on physical
 * notched hardware, which CI does not have. Hence this static guard.
 *
 * The utilities come from a local Tailwind plugin — see `tailwind.config.js`.
