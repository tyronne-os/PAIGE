/**
 * The kiro-light shell rules in index.css select plain hook classes
 * (`.user-bubble`, `.focus-chrome-rail`, ...), not Tailwind utilities, so the
 * phantom-classes gate never sees them: a refactor that drops one of those
 * classes from its component leaves the rule matching nothing, and the surface
 * quietly falls back to the token it was scoped away from -- the user bubble
 * back to white-on-white, the rail back to a white card on a white page.
 *
 * This pins each hook to the source file that must carry it, in both
 * directions: every class the kiro-light rules select must appear in its
 * component's markup, and every hook the components advertise for kiro-light
 * must still be selected by a rule -- otherwise a dropped rule leaves a dead
 * class behind that reads as load-bearing.
