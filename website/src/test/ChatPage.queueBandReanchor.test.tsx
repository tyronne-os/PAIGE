/**
 * A send that lands behind a busy turn mounts the queue stack between the
 * transcript and the composer AND appends a queued row to the message array.
 * The virtualizer's viewport branch does re-pin for the scroller shrink, but
 * the append regroups and remounts tail rows while the band's spring animates,
 * so that re-pin can land on interior heights that are still settling —
 * measured pre-fix: the scroller reports "at bottom" while the content sits a
 * card-height (~21px) low, recovering or not depending on which re-render
 * lands last. Users saw the reply's last line sliced at the clip edge directly
 * above the queue card, intermittently.
 *
 * The tip card and the survey card have the same geometry and are compensated
 * by the `[activeTip, surveyLayoutTick]` effect. The status stack CANNOT ride
 * that effect: the queue stack's height is spring-animated, so a one-shot
 * re-anchor at mount time measures a half-grown band and leaves the remainder
 * clipped. It gets a ResizeObserver on the stack wrapper instead — fired after
 * every layout step of the animation, each one re-anchoring while FOLLOW holds,
 * so the final write always follows the last height change instead of racing it.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT like the two neighbouring mask guards
 * (fadeClearance, statusStackAboveMask): the invariant is the wiring between
 * a JSX attribute, a callback ref, and the observer body — none of which jsdom
 * can exercise (happy-dom has no layout, so a real ResizeObserver never fires).
 *
 * The wiring spans two files because the two ends have different owners: the
 * JSX attribute belongs to the page, while the observer belongs to the same
 * controller that owns `scrollBottom`, the FOLLOW ref, and the sibling
 * tip/survey compensation effect. Reading both is what keeps the attribute and
 * the callback it names from drifting apart.
