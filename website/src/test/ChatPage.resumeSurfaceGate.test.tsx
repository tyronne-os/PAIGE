/**
 * ChatPage's "Continue a previous chat" resume must not retire the tab the user
 * is sitting in when the resume did not actually take effect (#5925).
 *
 * `handleResumeSession` performs a SWAP: resume the picked session, then delete
 * the slot it replaces and drop that slot's drafts. A resume answering with a
 * surface the chat page cannot display never performs the first half -- the
 * `resumeFromHistory.fulfilled` reducer short-circuits, leaving `activeSlot`
 * and the history row exactly as they were -- so running the second half closed
 * the tab the user was in, discarded the text they had just typed into it (the
 * suggestions list only appears once they type), and bounced them to an
 * unrelated peer, while the session they asked for never opened. The thunk's
 * `ok` cannot distinguish the two cases: the wire request succeeds either way,
 * which is why it returns `surface` at all (#3624).
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE: `handleResumeSession` is a `useCallback` defined inline inside the
 * very large `ChatPage` component and is not exported, and the existing
 * `ChatPage.*.test.tsx` harnesses stub out the sidebar/virtualization layers
 * rather than drive them live. Following the precedent set by
 * `ChatPage.handleFork.test.tsx`, this file mounts the same body against the
 * REAL `resumeFromHistory` / `deleteSlot` thunks and the real `api` module
 * (mocked at the network boundary), so the gate is exercised through the real
 * reducer that produces the condition it guards. The callback body is duplicated
 * from `ChatPage.tsx` rather than imported; if that body changes, update this
 * file with it.
