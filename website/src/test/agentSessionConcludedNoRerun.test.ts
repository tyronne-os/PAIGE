/**
 * A CONCLUDED investigation whose chat session was closed must not silently
 * start the work over.
 *
 * Closing the session is how a user marks an investigation done, and the record
 * says so: `issue_radar_record_investigation` defaults `status` to `resolved`, so
 * a record still reading `investigating` is one that never wrote a verdict.
 *
 * Before this, `openSession`'s fallback keyed only on a dead `slot_key`. That was
 * right for an investigation INTERRUPTED mid-flight -- the previous behaviour
 * there was a permanent dead end -- but on a finished one it re-seeded a whole
 * fresh investigation: re-doing completed work, spending an agent run, and
 * overwriting the verdict already on the record, all from a button that reads
 * "Resume".
 *
 * Both directions are pinned, because the wrong one is the expensive one:
 * `investigating` must still fall through to a replacement, and a concluded
 * record must decline until a second explicit click passes `force`.
