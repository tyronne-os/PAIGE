/** Every streaming prefix of a chat diff block must render without throwing.
 *  Pierre's PatchDiff itself asserts exactly-one-file-diff and THROWS on the
 *  partial frames a streaming fence produces (bare header lines, no hunk yet)
 *  — the wrapper must absorb those states rather than crash-looping the
 *  per-message error boundary.
 *
 *  Reaching that throw requires the lazy chunk to be RESOLVED: a render that
 *  is unmounted in the same tick only ever shows the Suspense fallback, so
 *  Pierre's parser is never entered and the suite proves nothing about the
 *  claim above. `warmPierre()` resolves the chunk once (module registry keeps
 *  it resolved for the rest of the file), and each prefix then flushes so
 *  PatchImpl actually mounts and parses before being torn down. */
