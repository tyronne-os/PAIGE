/**
 * REGRESSION GUARD — gap #2: TABLES.
 *
 * Tables are NOT a first-class block in `useBlockAssembler` (only code / diff /
 * mermaid / widget are); they render inline inside the markdown block, so they
 * get no `SmoothResize` wrapper and no streaming-aware handling. remark-gfm only
 * recognizes a GFM table once BOTH the header row and the `|---|---|` delimiter
 * row are present. So mid-stream:
 *
 *   1. the header line arrives  → renders as a <p> with literal "| A | B |" text
 *   2. the delimiter line arrives → the subtree RESTRUCTURES into a bordered
 *      <table> (padding, borders, overflow-x wrapper, different margins)
 *
 * Step 2 is a structural reflow of already-visible content — a snap/flash that
 * neither the `.ft-word` opacity fix (text-edge only) nor the virtualizer spacer
 * smoothing addresses. The desired behavior while streaming is
 * that an incomplete trailing table region is NOT shown as raw pipe-delimited
 * paragraph text that will later restructure — either withhold it until the
 * delimiter arrives (mirroring how incomplete fences are held) or render it as a
 * provisional table. Both fixes share one observable property: the literal
 * "| Col A | Col B |" pipe row is never painted as visible paragraph text.
 *
 * The GAP test asserts that property. The PREMISE tests document the
 * paragraph→table snap that the desired behavior hides.
