/**
 * The transcript's bottom mask is four numbers that only work as a set. Each
 * invariant below is a defect that actually shipped, so none of them is theoretical.
 *
 *  1. clearance >= the part ABOVE the scrollport edge. The clearance used to be
 *     `2vh + 8px` against a fixed 24px band, so it tracked the viewport and cleared
 *     by exactly 1px at 844px tall. Measured at 390px wide, scrolled to the bottom,
 *     the last line's bottom relative to the band's top: +1.0px at 844, then −1.0 at
 *     740, −2.0 at 700, −3.0 at 660, −5.0 at 560 — every phone viewport sliced the
 *     last line while every desktop one looked fine, which is why it read as
 *     mobile-only and a desktop reviewer could not see it.
 *  2. The clearance is stated in px, never viewport units — that unit IS defect 1.
 *  3. Layout neutrality: height == above + overshoot, and the two negative margins
 *     cancel the box exactly. A positive residual pushes the composer down.
 *  4. The overshoot equals ChatInput's own gap to the composer box (`pt-1` 4px plus
 *     the `h-[6px]` top spacer). Short, and a strip is left unmasked where the
 *     reported hairline shows; long, and the `z-[1]` mask paints over the composer
 *     box's top border and dims it.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT rather than a render: the numbers live in two files,
 * one of them as a Tailwind class jsdom cannot resolve into a height, and the
 * invariant is the arithmetic BETWEEN them.
