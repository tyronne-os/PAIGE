/**
 * Hold-to-talk mode: the WeChat-style swap where the mic becomes a mode switch
 * and the textarea is replaced by a press-and-hold target.
 *
 * The gesture's own state machine is covered in
 * `src/hooks/useTouchPushToTalk.test.ts`. What is covered HERE is the wiring
 * ChatInput owns: which surface is mounted, and — the part a reviewer caught —
 * that a draft arriving mid-capture does not tear the hold target out from under
 * the finger.
 *
 * Cases that claim a gesture DRIVE one, via the pointer helpers below. Hold-mode
 * survival over a draft is gated on the hook's exported ownership now, and
 * ownership is recorded only by the hook's own pointerdown — simulating capture
 * through props leaves the hook owning nothing, which is a DIFFERENT scenario
 * (the keyboard binding, or the mic-as-record-button). Two earlier tests here
 * asserted the wrong outcome precisely because their prop-only setup could not
 * tell the two apart (#5753).
