/**
 * The gate that guards the chokepoint.
 *
 * `eslint-rules/approval-one-shot-decision.js` is the only layer that sees a
 * trust verb BEFORE the mapping erases it: an inline
 * `action === 'rejected' ? 'reject' : 'approve'` converts the verb into
 * `approve` upstream of both the typed `api.resolveApproval` client and the
 * backend's 400, so no runtime guard downstream can catch the class that
 * shipped three times (#5400, #5434, #5486).
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS LEAD WITH VIOLATIONS: a suite that only lints the clean tree
 * passes when the rule works, when the rule is broken, when it is unwired from
 * `eslint.config.js`, and when it does not run at all — four states with one
 * green. So every test here asserts on a fixture that VIOLATES the rule and
 * requires the rule to flag it, linting through the REAL config exactly as
 * `npm run lint` does (the same outside-in approach as
 * `i18nStrictRule.test.ts`). The clean-tree direction is asserted too, but only
 * as the negative control.
