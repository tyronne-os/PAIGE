/**
 * A phone keyboard used to hide the caret you were typing at.
 *
 * The composer's status bars are flex-flow SIBLINGS of the transcript scroller,
 * not overlays. The scroller is `overflow-y:auto`, so its automatic minimum size
 * is 0 and it collapses under pressure, taking the `h-16` header spacer inside
 * it. An opening keyboard IS that pressure: `interactive-widget=resizes-content`
 * shrinks the layout viewport, the column shortens, and the uncapped stack's top
 * edge rises into the title band at `top-0` — which hosts the rename editor, one
 * z-layer below the bars, so they painted over the input.
 *
 * Two independent guards: the stack is capped and scrolls internally so it
 * yields space instead of climbing (covering all five bars, not just the
 * reported one), and the band outranks the bars while it hosts the editor. The
 * lift is conditional because at rest the band must stay BELOW the mobile
 * sessions scrim so an open drawer dims it; it is safe because opening the
 * drawer blurs the input, which commits and closes the editor.
 *
 * Asserted against SOURCE TEXT, as the transcript-mask geometry guard already
 * does: the cap is a viewport unit jsdom cannot resolve into a height, and the
 * real invariant is the ORDER BETWEEN three z-values living in two files.
