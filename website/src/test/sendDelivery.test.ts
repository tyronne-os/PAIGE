/**
 * Only an immediate dispatch is a receipt for the optimistic bubble.
 *
 * A `queued` response cannot stand in for one, in two independent ways. The
 * chat handler's busy branch queues only a NON-EMPTY message
 * (`if message: slot.queue_append(...)`) while answering `{ok: true, queued:
 * true}` either way, so a file-only send that races into it is dropped behind a
 * success-shaped body. And when it does queue, it broadcasts `queue_push` -- that
 * card is the server-owned representation of the message, so the bubble becomes a
 * duplicate whose fate diverges from the row's: cancelling the queued message
 * removes the card and leaves the bubble.
 *
 * Either way "confirmed" would be a claim about a message that never ran, which
 * is precisely what the 30s indicator is there to question.
