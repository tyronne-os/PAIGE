// Samples the renderer's memory trajectory so a cage OOM has a before, not just
// an after.
//
// This replaces `pierrePerf.ts` and `allocWatch.ts`, which were probes on
// suspected allocation PATHS. The renderer dies with `Near V8 cage limit` while
// the object heap reads 0.5% full, so the exhausted resource is the V8
// pointer-compression cage — address space that also holds every
// ArrayBuffer/TypedArray backing store. A path probe can only ever confirm or
// deny its own hypothesis, and there are ~25 ways to put a backing store in the
// cage without calling a JS buffer constructor (`response.arrayBuffer()`,
// `blob.arrayBuffer()`, `FileReader`, `getImageData`, `new ImageData`,
// `createImageBitmap`+`copyTo`, a WebSocket binary frame, `structuredClone`,
// IndexedDB reads, Cache Storage, `crypto.subtle`, `WebAssembly.Memory`,
// `TextEncoder.encode`, fetch-body stream chunks, `AudioBuffer`/`getChannelData`,
// MediaSource/WebCodecs output, `Buffer.alloc` in the preload's own realm, and
// anything at all inside a worker or subframe). So this measures the POOL those
// all drain into, and stops guessing at pipes.
//
// THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS is `externalKB`: V8's own accounting of backing stores
// plus external strings, i.e. the cage residents that are NOT in the object heap.
// Chromium exposes `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize` as
// `used_heap_size + external_memory` (`memory_info.cc`), and Electron exposes the
// object-heap half alone as `process.getHeapStatistics().usedHeapSize` (KB). The
// difference is external memory. Both readings come from the SAME isolate — with
// contextIsolation the preload gets its own v8::Context but shares the renderer's
// v8::Isolate — so the subtraction is valid rather than comparing two heaps.
//
// THE SELF-CHECK is why this cannot fail the way its predecessors did.
// `performance.memory` is bucketized and cached for 20 minutes unless the
// renderer is locked to a site, so a probe reading it can return a
// plausible-looking constant forever and read as "flat and healthy". The flush
// summary therefore reports `externalMoved=yes|NO-FROZEN-VALUE|unknown`, derived
// from whether the series ever produced two different values. A frozen series is
// named as broken instrumentation instead of being mistaken for a flat trend.
// `--enable-precise-memory-info` (armed in native-logging.js) removes the cause;
// this reports whether that worked.
//
// COST: one sample every 5s carrying four integers. No allocation is made to test
// the instrument — a synthetic 100MB probe buffer would itself add cage pressure
// to the resource under investigation, so the self-check is derived from the
// series that is being collected anyway.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION — deferred-deletion, not furniture. Once a crash dump shows
// either (a) `externalDelta` climbing into the hundreds of MB, naming
// backing-store growth as the cause, or (b) `externalDelta` flat with
// `externalMoved=yes`, which exonerates committed backing stores and hands the
// question to `cage-trace.js`'s reserved-address-space figure, the trajectory has
// done its job. Delete this module, its IPC channel, its preload entry and the
// main-side ring buffer then, rather than leaving a permanent sampler behind a
// settled question.
