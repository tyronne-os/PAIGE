/**
 * Host-side backup for the dashboard settings that live in `localStorage`.
 *
 * The problem this solves: most settings the user sets in the UI are stored
 * only in the renderer's `localStorage`, and `localStorage` is keyed by ORIGIN
 * and (in the desktop app) kept inside Electron's `userData` directory. Both
 * can change without the user doing anything: the dashboard port moves, the
 * `userData` directory is relocated by a package rename, the user switches
 * between the stable and nightly builds, or the browser evicts the origin. Each
 * of those looks identical from the user's chair — "I upgraded and had to set
 * everything up again" — even though nothing on the host was lost, because
 * nothing on the host was ever written.
 *
 * So: mirror the durable subset to the gateway (`/api/ui-prefs`, stored in the
 * data home), and read it back when a profile shows up with none of those keys.
 *
 * Design decisions worth knowing before changing this file:
 *
 * 1. **Read on a COLD profile only.** The server copy is a backup, not a live
 *    cross-tab sync channel. If any durable key exists locally, that copy wins
 *    and the server is only written to. Reading on every boot would let a stale
 *    backup fight a tab the user just changed, and would make two browsers on
 *    one host tug settings back and forth.
 * 2. **Snapshot-diff, not write interception.** ~300 call sites write
 *    `localStorage` directly. Rather than route them all through one writer (a
 *    migration that would go stale the next time someone adds a raw call), this
 *    module periodically reads the allowlisted keys and PUTs what changed. Any
 *    writer, present or future, is covered.
 * 3. **Explicit allowlist, no prefix wildcards for session-scoped keys.**
 *    Ephemeral and per-session state (height caches, panel tabs, drafts,
 *    touched files, web-preview URLs) is deliberately excluded: it is worthless
 *    on another origin, it is what the quota reclaimer already evicts, and
 *    mirroring it would grow without bound.
 * 4. **Keys already mirrored server-side are excluded** — theme mode, theme
 *    colour, language and the onboarding flags reconcile through
 *    `/api/config/theme` and `dashboard.*` config. Backing them up here too
 *    would create a second source of truth for the same setting.

/**
 * Durable, user-chosen preferences. Exact keys only.
 *
 * A key belongs here when a user would be annoyed to set it twice, and would
 * NOT be surprised to see it follow them to a new window. When in doubt leave
 * it out: a missing backup degrades to today's behaviour, while backing up
 * session-scoped state resurrects stale UI on an unrelated profile.
 *
 * Growing this list is safe ONLY because of the reconcile pass. A warm profile
 * never cold-hydrates (`needsHydrate` is false once `SYNCED_KEYS_KEY` exists),
 * so without it a newly added key's local DEFAULT -- often written by a hook on
 * mount -- would be flushed to the host before the host's own value was ever
 * read, overwriting a value another origin saved (growth-gap issue 9491).
 * `reconcileNewDurableKeys` runs before the first flush and reads the host copy
 * for keys this profile has never synced: an absent local key adopts the host
 * value, a present one is baselined so the first flush does not upload it. A
 * key counts as "new" when it is in neither the synced fingerprints nor the
 * reconciled roster (see `ROSTER_ENTRY`), so the pass costs one GET per
 * allowlist growth, not per boot.

 *     on a profile holding STALE values overwrote newer preferences another
 *     origin had already backed up. Fingerprints make that first flush send only

 *     profile restored the value the user had deleted.
 *  3. "Have we ever reached the host?" Its absence is what makes the boot-time
 *     hydrate retry. Without it, one failed fetch on a fresh profile burned the
 *     only restore attempt the backup exists for, because the first setting
 *     written afterwards made the profile look warm forever.
 *
 * Hashes rather than values: one of these keys can hold a large blob, and storing
 * the values would double their footprint in the very storage this feature exists
 * to protect. The hash only has to detect CHANGE, so a non-cryptographic string
