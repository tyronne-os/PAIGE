// Restore the host-side backup of the renderer's own settings BEFORE the first
// render, on any profile that has never successfully reached the host — a fresh
// browser profile, a moved dashboard port (localStorage is per-origin), or a
// relocated Electron userData directory. That is the case where the user would
// otherwise see every setting back at its default and conclude the upgrade ate
// them. Keyed on "never synced" rather than "no settings present" so a boot whose
// fetch failed retries on the next one instead of forfeiting the restore.
//
// When something WAS restored we reload rather than render. Restoring before the
// first render is not enough on its own: static imports are evaluated before any
// statement here, so a store that reads its key at module scope (e.g.
// hooks/useBottomTerminal.ts) has already captured the pre-restore value, and its
// first write would persist that stale copy back over what we just restored. A
// reload is the one move that is correct for every module-scope reader, present
// and future, without a per-store re-init hook a new store would silently miss.
// It costs one extra load on a fresh profile and cannot loop: hydrateUiPrefs
// records the synced marker, so the next boot does not hydrate, and even with
// that write dropped the second pass finds the keys present and restores nothing.
//
// Sync starts ONLY once this profile knows the host's state — i.e. the GET landed,
// which is what clears needsHydrate(). If the fetch failed we render but do NOT
// sync: the local keys at that moment are whatever the defaults-persisting hooks
// just wrote, and uploading those would overwrite the very backup the failed
// restore was trying to read. No sync means no backup for this session and the
// next boot retries the restore. The asymmetry is deliberate — losing one
// session's backup is recoverable, overwriting the host's copy is not.
//
// A profile that has synced pays nothing: needsHydrate() is a synchronous
// localStorage read, so the usual launch renders on the same tick as before. The
// first-time path is bounded by hydrateUiPrefs' own timeout, and a gateway that
// never answers renders defaults rather than hanging the boot. See lib/uiPrefs.ts.
