/** The iOS-style navigation back bar, shared by EVERY level of the mobile
 *  push stack — SidePanelLayout's tab detail ("‹ Settings") and
 *  SettingsSubNav's drilled-in pane ("‹ Channels") render this one component,
 *  so the bar keeps identical geometry, tint and blur across levels and the
 *  back control does not visibly jump as the user pushes and pops.
 *
 *  Sticky to the nearest scroll container, on a blurred translucent wash of
 *  the page bg (color-mix because the theme vars carry no <alpha-value> —
 *  Tailwind's /opacity modifiers silently no-op) with a hairline bottom edge.
 *  The chevron lands 10px from the content edge (16px inset − 6px optical
 *  pull) at every level; a host whose pane already pads horizontally bleeds
 *  the bar back out via `className` (e.g. `-mx-4`) so the wash stays
 *  full-width.
 *
 *  THE BAR OWNS THE GAP BENEATH ITSELF (`mb-3`), at every level, so a host
 *  never has to supply one and the two levels cannot drift apart. Without it
 *  whatever follows renders ON the hairline: measured at 390px, the tab title
 *  0px from the hairline to its cap height, and at the SubNav level the
 *  leading element's own BORDER on the line — two lines touching, with
 *  nothing to read as separation. A margin rather than padding because the bar
 *  is sticky: the gap belongs to the bar's FLOW position, so content still
 *  scrolls under the wash instead of stopping short of it.
