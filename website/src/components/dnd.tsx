 *  no other candidate — including one UNRELATED to the rest — lands in the
 *  first peel, so unrelated candidates keep their incoming order only
 *  relative to EACH OTHER, and a caller that must keep an unrelated zone
 *  from outranking containers pre-filters it (sidebarCollision consults the
 *  chat-pane zone in a separate step for exactly this reason). Absolute DOM
 *  depth is never a priority: only a proven contains() relation reorders.
 *  Iterative leaf peeling keeps each round's group internally in incoming
 *  order, so the result is deterministic and transitivity-safe (contains()
 *  is a partial order; no pairwise sort comparator is involved). */

 * lane's box stays viewport-sized. The ancestor's smaller box then out-ranks
