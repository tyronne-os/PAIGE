 * Track word-level revisions across consecutive partial hypotheses.

 * The STT backend re-decodes the current phrase every few hundred ms and the
 * new hypothesis replaces the old wholesale, so which words actually changed is
 * invisible. This aligns each hypothesis against the previous one and marks
 * three cases apart: a word that came back identical gets its stability count
 * bumped (rendered as increasing opacity — the longer a word survives, the more
 * solid it looks); a word revised in place gets its generation bumped
 * (remounting its span, which restarts a brief bright-to-dim flash); and words
 * appended past the previous hypothesis are new dictation, so they start dim
 * without flashing.
 *
 * Alignment anchors on text with a small lookahead instead of matching by
 * position alone: an insertion, split, or deletion mid-hypothesis shifts every
 * later index, and a positional diff would then mark the entire tail as revised
 * — flashing and de-solidifying words the recogniser never touched. The
 * lookahead re-anchors on the unchanged tail so only the words that actually
 * changed carry the revision signal. Anchoring is skipped when the SAME token
 * also occupies the current new position ("a b c" → "a c c"): jumping to the
 * old "c" would read that replacement as deletion-plus-append and the changed
 * word would never flash. An inserted word flashes (it IS a revision); a
 * dropped word simply disappears.
 *
 * Recomputes only when (committed, partial) actually changed and returns the
 * cached result otherwise, which keeps the render pure under StrictMode's
 * double-invoke. A committed-text change means the phrase was cut and a new one
 * began, so tracking resets; ids are never reused, so a fresh phrase's words
 * mount as new elements instead of tweening from the dead phrase's spans.
