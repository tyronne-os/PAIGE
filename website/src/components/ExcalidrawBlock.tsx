/**
 * Inline Excalidraw diagram.
 *
 * Renders an Excalidraw scene (`.excalidraw` JSON) as inline SVG — the same
 * treatment `MermaidBlock` gives a ```mermaid fence, and deliberately NOT the
 * iframe used for `<mcwidget>` HTML. Inline SVG reflows with the chat column and
 * stays selectable; an iframe would box the diagram off from both.
 *
 * The renderer (and rough.js behind it) is pulled in with a dynamic `import()`
 * so it stays out of the entry chunk. This module sits on the critical path —
 * every chat message renders through `MarkdownRenderer` — while an Excalidraw
 * fence is rare, so a static import would tax every user for a feature most
 * never hit. The promise is cached at module scope so N diagrams on a page share
 * one load; `import()` is idempotent regardless.
 *
 * The diagram is rendered against its own painted canvas rather than composited
 * onto the dashboard, so it does NOT depend on the active theme. That is
 * deliberate: a scene carries the author's explicit colours (typically near-black
 * ink), and restyling it per theme would either distort those colours or leave
 * the diagram invisible on a dark surface. It also means there is no theme state
 * for this effect to track and go stale against.
 *
 * On any failure (malformed JSON, truncated stream, empty scene) it explains
 * itself and falls back to the source. A diagram should never cost the user the
 * content — if we can't draw it, they still get the text.
