/**
 * EmbeddedHostBridge — the embedded (remote-pane) half of the
 * consolidated-header relay.
 *
 * When this dashboard SPA runs inside an InstancesViewport <iframe> it has no
 * knowledge of the parent's instance list, which pane is active, or whether the
 * parent is a macOS Electron window whose native traffic lights overlap the top
 * of the pane. The parent relays all of that down as a single `mc-host-model`
 * postMessage; this bridge stores it in `instances.host` so the embedded header
 * can render the instance switcher inline (EmbeddedInstanceTabBar) and the
 * readout capsule can show the tunnel refresh countdown — collapsing
 * the remote pane's two bars into one.
 *
 * Security: we only trust messages whose `event.source` is our direct parent
 * (`window.parent`). The parent independently validates the loopback ORIGIN of
 * our switch requests (see InstancesViewport / tunnelOrigin), so trust is gated
 * on both ends. Non-embedded (top-level) dashboards mount this as a no-op.

// Deliberately BOUNDED, not an infinite loop: the schedule is capped and its
// total (~7.75s of cumulative delay) stays comfortably under the parent's

// re-posting and falls through to the parent's error panel (which carries Retry)
// instead of spinning — the cure and the give-up are both finite.
