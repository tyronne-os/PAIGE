/**
 * Confirmation + undo for an item dragged into a folder.
 *
 * A drag is a coarse gesture: drop an item one row off and it vanishes into a
 * folder the user never sees, with nothing on screen saying where it went. This
 * bar names the destination and offers the inverse move back for
 * {@link MOVE_UNDO_MS}.
 *
 * The `session*` i18n keys and `session-move-undo*` test ids are retained rather
 * than renamed with the component: the strings are translated in every locale
 * catalogue and the ids are what the screenshot capture script selects on, so
 * renaming them would be churn and breakage for no behavioural gain.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in the flow rather than floating
 *
 * It renders as a sibling BELOW the session lanes and ABOVE the "Older
 * Sessions" footer, so it occludes nothing: not the footer (a persistent
 * control) and not the list row that just moved — which is exactly the row the
 * user needs to see to judge whether the drop was right. The cost is that the
 * footer shifts down by the bar's height while it is up; that is paid back by
 * the 150ms height transition, and by never covering the evidence.
 *
 * ## Keyboard
 *
 * ⌘Z / Ctrl+Z fires undo while the bar is up — the platform undo chord, NOT
 * ⌘C (copy). The handler stands down while focus is in a text field so the
 * composer keeps its own undo history, and ignores ⇧⌘Z (redo).
 *
 * ## The offer's lifecycle (owned by {@link useMoveUndo}, documented here)
 *
 * This component only renders an offer; the hook decides when one exists. That
 * state machine is the part a future editor is most likely to break, so it is
 * written down once, here, rather than inferred from scattered comments:
 *
 * ```
 *   drag drop ──► PENDING ──ack──► LIVE ──► (undo | expiry | mismatch) ──► gone
 *                    │                                                      ▲
 *                    └── another placement observed → superseded ───────────┘
 * ```
 *
 *  - **PENDING** — the move is optimistic, so the store shows the destination
 *    before the server has agreed. The bar is NOT rendered yet: arming here
 *    would let undo fire against stale server state and be silently reversed
 *    when the original write lands.
 *  - **superseded** — while pending, the only legitimate placements are the
 *    origin (write not applied / rolled back) and the destination (applied).
 *    Any third value is another client's move landing inside the window; it is
 *    latched, because by ack time live state may match the destination again
 *    (a move away and back) and nothing later could tell.
 *  - **LIVE** — the server acknowledged and nothing was latched. The bar
 *    renders; an 8s deadline owned by the hook retires it.
 *  - **gone** — one-way. An offer is dropped, never re-validated, so a retired
 *    offer cannot come back and replay its inverse over a newer move.
