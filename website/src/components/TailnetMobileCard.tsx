 * the `occupied` step, so the card renders the manual command (see the
 * `occupied` branch below, which prints `kirocrew tailnet up`) instead of a
 * publish button that would overwrite a mount it could not identify.
 *
 * **Setup is one explicit mutation, even across a gateway restart.** The click
 * itself is the operator's consent to every in-scope step, so the mutation may
 * resume when the listener comes back and mint the QR. It never runs on render,

                `install` is excluded, and not for cosmetic reasons: with Download

                `max-two-buttons-per-row` (website/AUTOSDE.yaml, blocking), which

                a fix. Expanding the invite refetches instead, so returning from
