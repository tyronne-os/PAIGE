/**

 * the message, so a refusal rendered as JSON in the UI and no caller could
 * branch on the status at all.
 *
 * The body is read ONCE and tolerates a read failure (`.catch`), because a
 * refusal mid-stream must still produce the status rather than an unrelated
 * throw. The header read is equally defensive (`?.`): this function runs on the
 * failure path, so anything it throws REPLACES the real error with a misleading
 * one — a `Response`-like object without `headers` would surface "Cannot read
 * properties of undefined" where the backend had said "path is outside the
 * allowed roots". The `HTTP <status>` fallback is what the previous bare-Error
 * calls used for an empty body, so an empty-body refusal reads exactly as it did
 * before.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT journal to `utils/errorReport` and does NOT raise the
 * stale-owner prompt, both of which `client.ts::apiFailure` does on top of this.
 * Those are dashboard-session concerns tied to the dashboard's own error banner,
 * and they are the side effects this module exists to keep out of app bundles.
 * An app that wants them can call the dashboard client instead.
