   * Rationale: while a message streams, its element's height changes on

   * reading history, that spacer sits directly below their viewport, and the
   * large discrete jump reads as a visible flash — unrelated to (and never
   * fixed by) the separate text-reveal-edge flash fixes in MarkdownRenderer.
   * Passing the live streaming index here makes that row's growth track the
   * viewport every tick instead. Every OTHER row keeps the debounced path
