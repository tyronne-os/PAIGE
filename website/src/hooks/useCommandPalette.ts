/**
 * Global trigger + open/close state for the Search Everywhere command palette.
 * The activation gesture is user-configurable (Settings → Shortcuts); this hook
 * reads the stored {@link QuickSearchConfig} live per keystroke and dispatches
 * accordingly. The three preset modes are:
 *
 *  - **`mod-k`** (default): ⌘K (macOS) / Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux) toggles the
 *    palette; double-Shift is off.
 *  - **`double-shift`** (opt-in): two bare `Shift` keydowns within
 *    {@link DOUBLE_SHIFT_WINDOW_MS}. This is the IntelliJ "Search Everywhere"
 *    gesture and is page-safe — a lone Shift has no default browser action, so
 *    nothing needs cancelling and it never collides with a real shortcut. It was
 *    the shipped default until remote-desktop sessions (RDP/ICA/PCoIP) were found
 *    to synthesise spurious repeat Shift events and open the palette by
 *    themselves.
 *  - **`custom`**: a user-recorded chord toggles the palette; double-Shift is
 *    off.
 *
 * **⌘K / Ctrl+K is a built-in alias in every mode EXCEPT `custom` with a
 * recorded chord.** It toggles the palette, `preventDefault()` keeps a
 * browser/extension binding (e.g. some "focus search") from stealing it, and it
 * is intentionally chosen over reserved combos (⌘P print, ⌘W close tab, ⌘1–9
 * tab switch) which Chrome will NOT let a page cancel. Keeping it live until the
 * user sets their OWN chord guarantees the palette is always reachable from the
 * keyboard — so selecting `custom` before recording never strands the user.
 * Because ⌘K is live in the default (`mod-k`) mode too, a user who relied on the
 * previously shipped double-Shift default still has a working keyboard route to
 * the palette after the default moved, even before they visit Settings.
 *
 * All bindings honour the global "Enable shortcuts" toggle
 * ({@link SHORTCUTS_ENABLED_KEY}, shared with useKeyboardShortcuts /
 * useInstanceShortcuts and surfaced by the Settings → Shortcuts "Search
 * Everywhere" row). Both the flag and the shortcut config are read live per
 * keystroke — a Settings change takes effect without re-registering the
 * listener — so when shortcuts are off, every binding falls through to the
 * browser. The palette stays reachable via its nav button, which calls
 * `openPalette` directly and is unaffected by the gate.
 *
 * The listener is attached to `window` (not an element) so the gesture works
 * regardless of focus — including while a chat textarea or a nav row is
 * focused — matching the "search everywhere" intent.
 *
 * Mount the returned `open`/`close` into a single `<CommandPalette/>` at the
 * app shell; the palette itself owns the in-modal keyboard nav (arrows / Enter
 * / Tab / Esc) via `useListKeyboardNav`, so this hook deliberately stops at the
 * trigger + visibility toggle.

/**
 * Max gap between the two Shift keydowns to count as a double-tap. Kept
 * deliberately tight (250ms): a wider window makes the palette pop open on
 * incidental Shift taps (e.g. reaching for a capital, then hesitating) that
 * were never meant as the gesture. 250ms is comfortably reachable as an
 * intentional double-tap while cutting most accidental opens; ⌘K / Ctrl+K and
 * the nav button remain as unambiguous alternatives.
