/**
 * Smoothing buffer for streamed text.
 *
 * Raw streaming jitter comes from welding render cadence to network cadence:
 * `chatSlice` appends each WS delta straight into the message content, so the
 * visible text lurches forward by whatever chunk just landed (1 char or a whole
 * sentence) and freezes in the gaps between bursts.
 *
 * This hook sits between the raw growing `content` and what the renderer sees.
 * It is a constant-latency controller (the shape of an audio jitter buffer):
 * the reveal aims to trail the live edge by a fixed time lag, so
 *
 *     rate = backlog / LAG_SECS
 *
 * which self-regulates against every failure mode:
 *   - a steady model at R chars/sec settles a standing backlog of R·LAG chars
 *     and reveals at exactly R — smooth, with a constant ~LAG_SECS delay;
 *   - a network burst raises the backlog, so the rate ramps up (slew-limited,
 *     below) and the excess drains exponentially with time constant LAG_SECS —
 *     drain time is inherently bounded (and MAX_CPS keeps the cascade at a
 *     speed the eye can follow — see the constants below);
 *   - a gap between bursts is absorbed by the standing backlog: the reveal
 *     keeps flowing (decaying gently, never freezing) for up to ~LAG_SECS
 *     before it can starve — so the reveal never freezes at the live edge and
 *     then surges on the next burst, the freeze→surge cycle the eye reads as
 *     "chunks".
 *
 * The applied rate is additionally slew-limited (low-pass filtered), so burst
 * arrivals read as smooth accelerations rather than step changes, and a MIN
 * floor keeps text flowing even when the model idles. On stream end the same
 * dynamics drain the remainder (exponential tail + MIN floor), so short/fast
 * messages still animate fully.
 *
 * Emission is at char granularity — we re-render only when the floored reveal
 * cursor actually advances, not on every rAF frame.
 *
 * When `enabled` is false the hook is a no-op pass-through (returns `content`
 * unchanged, no rAF loop), so `streamMode: 'immediate'` restores the exact
 * pre-existing behavior.

 *  chunk) clears as a ~2.5s fast cascade instead of trailing at the cap for
 *  8+ seconds — while ordinary bursts (≤ MAX_CPS × MAX_DRAIN_SECS ≈ 1.5K
