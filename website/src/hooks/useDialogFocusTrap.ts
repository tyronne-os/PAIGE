/**
 * Wire a dialog element for modal keyboard use.
 *
 * `containerRef` must point at the dialog root (the `role="dialog"` element).
 * `onEscape` is called on Escape — the caller decides whether that actually
 * closes (e.g. a dialog with work in flight can refuse).
 *
 * `enabled` exists for stacked dialogs: a dialog that opens a dialog of its own
 * must stop trapping Tab, or focus is dragged back out of the inner one on every
 * keypress. Pass `false` for as long as an inner dialog owns the keyboard.
 * Only the key handling is gated — focus-in on mount and focus-restore on
 * unmount are deliberately NOT, because tying them to `enabled` would restore
 * focus to whatever was focused before the OUTER dialog opened (i.e. behind
 * both overlays) the moment the inner one appears.
 *
 * `handleEscape` may be disabled when a caller deliberately owns Escape on a
 * bubble-phase listener. Modal uses that path so a nested overlay can consume
 * Escape before the outer dialog observes it, while this hook still owns focus
 * entry, restoration, and Tab trapping.
 *
 * `restoreFocus` gates ONLY the return half: focus still moves into the dialog
 * on mount, but nothing is captured or restored on unmount. Pass `false` from a
 * trigger-anchored popover whose host already moves focus back itself, for two
 * reasons this hook cannot decide from the inside:
 *
 *   - The capture is `document.activeElement` at mount, and on Safari a clicked
 *     button is not focused — so for a popover opened by a click the capture
 *     lands on `<body>`, and the unmount-ordered restore then runs AFTER the
 *     host's own `trigger.focus()` and blurs the trigger it just focused.
 *   - The restore is unconditional, and a trigger-anchored popover's is
 *     deliberately not: dismissal by an outside click leaves focus where the
 *     click put it (#2533) instead of yanking it back to the trigger.
 *
 * A dialog with no single trigger (the Modal family) has neither problem and
 * keeps the default.
 *
 * The keydown listener is CAPTURE phase on purpose: dialogs stop keydown
 * propagation so the page's own shortcuts don't fire while the user types
 * inside them, and a bubble-phase listener would then never see Escape or Tab
 * from inside the dialog — breaking both dismissal and the trap.
