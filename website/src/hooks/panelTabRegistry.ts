 * data — it never names a specific app — and mounts each tab's `entry` through
 * the same in-process ESM app host `ui.pages` use (an `AppHost`), so a second
 * tab-contributing app costs no host change and no app code crosses the boundary.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function over a locally pinned subset of `GET /api/apps` (same
 * reason `overlaySlots.ts` and `appNav.ts` pin their own records): a field this
 * derivation depends on cannot quietly change shape underneath it. The manifest
 * is the source of truth, so an installed app declares a tab — the edition (and
 * the core) register nothing.
