/**
 * useDashboardHealthProbe — same-tab self-recovery from gateway-disconnect.
 *
 * Problem this solves:
 *   When the WebSocket drops (gateway restart, network blip, dev reload), the
 *   dashboard renders the "Gateway offline — reconnecting" banner and
 *   `useWebSocket` retries with exponential backoff (1s →
 *   2s → 4s → 8s → 10s capped, infinite).
 *
 *   The browser WebSocket API can't see the HTTP status of a failed upgrade
 *   handshake (just `onclose`), so a 401/403 looks identical to a connection
 *   refused. If the gateway restarted, its in-memory HMAC secret regenerates
 *   and existing session cookies become invalid — every WS reconnect attempt
 *   then fails with 401, the loop just keeps retrying forever, and the user
 *   has no in-tab signal that they need to re-auth.
 *
 *   The Electron desktop app recovers via `did-navigate`; web browser users
 *   (e.g. via SSH tunnel) do not, which is what this hook handles.
 *
 * Recovery mechanism:
 *   While `dashboard.connected === false`, poll a lightweight HTTP endpoint
 *   (`/api/status`) every `INTERVAL_MS`. The response carries the standard
 *   auth headers, so:
 *     - 200: gateway is back up AND auth is valid → call `forceReconnect()`
 *       on the WS hook to reset the backoff timer and reconnect immediately.
 *     - 403 with `X-Auth-Required: true`: gateway is back up but the cookie
 *       is invalid. The existing `checkSessionExpired` helper in
 *       `api/client.ts` already injects the in-tab auth banner, so the user
 *       can paste a fresh `kirocrew token` URL without leaving the tab. Once
 *       they do, the page navigates to `?token=X`, gets a fresh cookie, and
 *       reloads — recovery complete.
 *     - Network error / non-403 4xx-5xx: gateway still down or in a bad
 *       state. Stay quiet, keep polling.
 *
 *   When `dashboard.connected === true` (WS is healthy), the polling loop
 *   stops — no wasted requests during normal operation.
 *
 * Why poll instead of relying on WS reconnect alone:
 *   1. WS reconnect is blind to auth — it can't surface "you need to re-auth"
 *      to the user. The HTTP probe trips the existing 403 handler that
 *      shows the token-paste banner.
 *   2. WS reconnect backoff caps at 10s. The probe runs at 3s so recovery
 *      after gateway restart is ~3s instead of 10s.
 *   3. The probe is cheap (single GET to a sub-millisecond handler) and only
 *      runs while disconnected, so steady-state cost is zero.
