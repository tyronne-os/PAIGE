 *  an external allocation inside the sandbox reservation the fatal reads as a
 *  CAGE OOM with an almost empty JS heap — which is why it never looked like a

 *      <--- Near heap limit --->

 *  are both unavailable to us: the 1000-char `tokenizeMaxLineLength` does not
 *  apply (exponential backtracking needs only tens of characters), and
 *  `tokenizeTimeLimit` is hardcoded to `0` — no limit — inside `@pierre/diffs`,

 *  window is `viewportHeight + overscrollSize * 2`, so 1000 keeps roughly two
 *  screens of rows built above and below the visible ones — enough that a fast
 *  flick lands on painted rows rather than on the spacer. The observer margin is
 *  the lead time for computing the NEXT window: at 0 the IntersectionObserver
 *  only fires once a row reaches the viewport edge, which is too late and shows
 *  as blank rows while scrolling.
