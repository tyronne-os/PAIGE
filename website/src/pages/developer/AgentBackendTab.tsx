/**
 * Developer > Agent Backend — pick which agent runs a session.
 *
 * ## Why this exists again
 *
 * The public core used to ship a multi-provider `ProviderPanel` and deleted it
 * when it collapsed to Kiro CLI only (`refactor(website): collapse provider layer
 * to KiroACP-only`). The backend kept all three agents wired the whole time, so
 * `agent.acp_backend` has been switchable with no way to switch it. This is that
 * control, minus the dead parts of the old panel (Bedrock model ids, a Claude Code
 * migration wizard, a provider enum that now has exactly one member).
 *
 * ## Why the choices come from the server
 *
 * Every agent the code knows about is listed, but only the ones this build can
 * actually run are selectable — that set is read from `GET /api/config/schema`
 * (`enumValues`), which the backend resolves per request from
 * `acp_backends.selectable_backend_values()`, the same owner
 * `PATCH /api/config/kirocrew` validates against. So the enabled options and the
 * values the wire accepts cannot disagree, and a build that ships another agent
 * lights it up here with no frontend change.
 *
 * That last clause is why `candidates` is a union of server answers rather than a
 * list of ids written here. An earlier revision filtered a hard-coded
 * `[KIRO, CLAUDE, KAS]` by the schema, which narrows correctly and can never widen —
 * so an agent an edition registered through `register_selectable_backend` was
 * selectable on the wire and invisible in the only control that sets it. Ids this
 * frontend has no translated name for render under their `policy_id`.
 *
 * ## Why there is a SECOND gate, and why it is allowed to say nothing
 *
 * The schema answers a build/edition-and-policy question — can this gateway serve
 * that agent at all. It cannot answer the machine question: whether the harness's
 * components are actually installed here. So a build that ships an agent lit the
 * option up whether or not the binary existed, and a user could neither see why it
 * was dead nor be told what to install. `GET /api/acp-backends` supplies that
 * second fact per backend, and the two compose: an option is dead when this build
 * will not serve it OR this machine is missing it.
 *
 * The probe has THREE answers and the third is load-bearing. `unknown` means the
 * check itself failed, and it leaves the option ENABLED — collapsing it onto
 * `missing` would tell someone to run a global install for something they may
 * already have. The same fail-open applies to the query being in flight, having
 * failed, or the endpoint answering 403 (non-owner) or 404 (older gateway): all of
 * those are absent information, not a verdict, so gating falls back to the schema
 * alone and behaves exactly as it did before this endpoint existed. Nothing here
 * flashes disabled and then live. The owner `PATCH` allowlist is the real gate, so
 * an optimistic enable can only ever cost one visible refusal, while an optimistic
 * DISABLE costs a user a control they were entitled to and an install they did not
 * need.
 *
 * ## Why each row says so little
 *
 * An earlier revision wrote a prose sentence per agent claiming what each one
 * supports — sandboxing, shared processes, mid-turn steer, subagent progress.
 * Those claims were not measured anywhere; they were asserted here, in the view
 * layer, where nothing can contradict them. They were wrong in the ways
 * unmeasured claims usually are.
 *
 * The status line per row is therefore limited to what this build can actually
 * establish, and the vocabulary is taken from the ACP-adapter card rather than
 * invented again: `Default. All features supported.` for the backend whose
 * descriptor is all-supported, `Experimental` for one that is not, and a
 * not-enabled line for one this build cannot run. Per-capability detail
 * (which feature is supported, degraded, or unverified per backend) needs the
 * descriptor table that owns those facts and is deliberately NOT restated here.
 *
 * The two probe lines (missing components, and check-failed) are the exception
 * that proves the rule rather than a relaxation of it: they are not claims about
 * what a backend supports, they are a measurement the server took on this machine
 * and named. They say only what was measured — which components are absent, and
 * the command that installs them when there is one to give.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT under `pages/settings/`: `gen-settings-registry.mjs` scans that
 * directory, and indexing an agent switch into Settings search would advertise it
 * as an ordinary preference — it changes which agent binary runs.

   * A standing caveat about the harness itself, independent of whether it is

   *
   * ## Tool gating, which is stated here
   *
   * The DEFAULT path is gated: Claude asks, `claude-agent-acp` turns that into
   * `session/request_permission`, and Crew's own approval path decides. What escapes
   * is narrower and worth stating precisely -- a tool ALREADY pre-approved in Claude's
   * own settings never asks at all, because the SDK approves an allow-rule match
   * before consulting the client. Those settings include a `.claude/settings.json`
   * inside the project directory, which is the copy an operator did not write.
   *
   * That is documented, intended Claude behaviour rather than a defect here, but it
   * means the guarantee differs per harness. An operator choosing between harnesses is
   * choosing between governance models, so the panel names the difference instead of
   * letting them find it in a shell command that never asked. It is a TOOL-GATING
   * disclosure and not an auth one, so nothing below replaces it.
   *
   * Which is why this returns a LIST rather than one string. Claude is the harness
   * that carries both -- its tool gating has the caveat above AND it signs in through
   * its own credential file -- and an earlier revision returned early on the gating
   * line, so the one harness with two facts to state showed one of them.
   *
   * ## Signing in, which the SERVER states
   *
   * `auth.sign_in_remedy` arrives as a finished sentence and is rendered verbatim;
   * `auth.signs_in_separately` decides whether it is rendered at all, because a
   * harness that authenticates through Crew's own identity store has no separate
   * sign-in to finish. Absent `auth` says nothing, like every other absent probe
   * field.
   *
   * It is NOT translated, and that is the trade rather than an oversight. A
   * translated per-harness sentence is, by construction, a per-harness edit to
   * thirteen locale files, so the harness that needs the sentence most -- one an
   * edition registered and this frontend has never heard of -- is exactly the one
   * that would get no sentence at all. An untranslated remedy that is CORRECT beats
   * a translated one nobody adds.
   *
   * This also finishes the pattern the option list already follows: `candidates` is
   * a union of server answers rather than ids written here, and `nameOf` falls back
   * to the wire id when this frontend has no translated name. The `value === CODEX`
   * branch this replaces was the panel's last per-harness literal. Now the server
   * names a harness and states its remedy, and adding one costs no edit here.
   *
   * Still a caveat and not a probe line, deliberately. A measurement here would gate
   * the control -- `missing` disables the chip -- and the paths that authenticate a
   * harness are not all checkable: an ambient key, a relocated config home, an
   * adapter carrying its own configuration. Each of those is an operator whose switch
   * we would have disabled while they were already signed in, which the probe module
   * names as the more expensive mistake. A standing sentence cannot be wrong in that
