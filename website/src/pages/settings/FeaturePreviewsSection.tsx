/**
 * Settings > Developer > Feature Previews — opt in to surfaces that ship in the
 * bundle but are not released yet (see `utils/previewFlags.ts`).
 *
 * Formerly its own tab on the standalone Developer page (`/developer`). It moved
 * here because the switch that HOLDS an unreleased feature belongs next to the
 * switch that REVEALS the developer tooling (Developer Mode, one section up):
 * both are per-device consent gates, and a reader looking for "how do I turn
 * the unfinished thing on" looks in Settings, not on an internals page they
 * first have to unlock. `DeveloperPage.tsx` redirects the old
 * `/developer?tab=feature-previews` link here.
 *
 * The USER-FACING copy says "features" and "pages", never "surfaces": `Surface`
 * is the registry's internal term and means nothing to the operator reading the
 * toggle. The component and catalog keys keep the code vocabulary on purpose —
 * they name the mechanism, not the copy. The catalog keys also keep their
 * historical `pages.developer.featurePreviewsTab.*` namespace: renaming seven
 * keys across fourteen catalogs buys no user-visible change, and the section
 * itself still describes the developer-tooling gate it started as.
 *
 * ONE CARD PER FEATURE, and everything that belongs to a feature lives inside
 * its card: the headline, the sentence explaining what state it is in, its
 * toggle, and any ingress that only appears once it is on. A reader scanning the
 * section can then take a card as the whole story of one preview, rather than
 * pairing a row against an ingress rendered somewhere below it.
 *
 * One explicit card per preview flag rather than a loop over a table: the copy
 * has to be a static `i18nT('literal')` call for `check-i18n-keys.mjs` to
 * resolve it, and a table of key strings indexed per card is exactly the dynamic
 * pattern that gate cannot follow. A preview flag is also meant to be
 * short-lived, so the cost of a card is paid once and then deleted with it.
 *
 * Under `pages/settings/` ON PURPOSE, reversing the old tab's stance:
 * `gen-settings-registry.mjs` scans this directory, so the three toggles ARE
 * indexed into Settings search (`PANEL_TAB_MAP` maps this file to `developer`).
 * The old tab kept itself out of the index so that searching "webhooks" would
 * not advertise a hidden page. In Settings the calculus flips: a control the
 * user can see on a Settings pane but cannot find through Settings search is
 * the exact coverage gap the settings-coverage gate exists to close, and what
 * the search hit reaches is the opt-in switch — labelled as a preview — not the
 * page it holds. The PAGE stays un-advertised: `getAdvertisedSurfaces()` and
 * the Search Everywhere Pages provider still filter it until the flag is on.
 *
 * No `configKey` on these toggles, deliberately. That prop names a
 * `config.json` path so `<SettingRef>` chips can deep-link, and preview flags
 * are per-device localStorage keys by design (`previewFlags.ts` explains why
 * they are NOT backend config). Search deep-links still reach each toggle
 * through its registry id + `data-setting-label`, which need no configKey.
 *
 * Each card may also carry a "See what it looks like" button (`FeaturePreviewIntroButton`)
 * opening a dialog with a REAL capture of the surface the flag reveals, a
 * sentence on what it does, where it appears once on, and the same switch again.
 * The intro is defined right here next to its card — the card IS the preview's
 * definition — as a render-time builder rather than a table of catalog keys,
 * for the same `check-i18n-keys.mjs` reason the cards are not a loop: the gate
 * resolves a literal `i18nT('…')`, not a key read out of a nested object. A
 * preview whose surface has not been captured yet (below: "Chat on a crew",
 * whose menu entry only exists with a live tunnel to a second machine, which an
 * isolated capture instance cannot honestly stage) simply has no builder and so
 * no button — never a dialog with an empty frame.

          NO ingress button, for the same reason as the crew card: turning it on

          already in front of the user.

          NO "See what it looks like" yet either, and that is the missing-capture rule, not
          an omission: the entry it adds only renders while a tunnel to a second
          machine is live (`warmCrews.length > 0` in ChatSidebar), and the
          isolated instance the captures come from has no honest way to stage
          one. A dialog with a staged or drawn frame would break the promise the
