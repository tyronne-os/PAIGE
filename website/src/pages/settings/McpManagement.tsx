/**
 * MCP Management — two decisions, one per layer, and nothing else.
 *
 * Per server (the table): interpose Kiro Crew's stub. That alone is what lets the
 * server render its own UI, and it leaves the backend private to each session —
 * the useful state for a server that holds per-session state.
 *
 * Global (the card): route those stubs to ONE shared backend process. Sharing is
 * the only thing this switch does, and it can only act on servers that already
 * have a stub, so the two layers never overlap.
 *
 * The words matter here: "stub" is the per-server layer and "routing to a shared
 * backend" is the global one. Naming the per-server switch "route" would claim the
 * global layer's job for it, which is exactly the confusion this page has to avoid.
 *
 * There is deliberately no per-server sharing control. The previous page had one,
 * which is how an operator could end up with sharing "on" while the allowlist it
 * acted on was empty — a switch with no observable effect.
 *
 * The second sub-view, "Sharing assessment", adds NO third decision. It is
 * read-only evidence: what the gateway managed to observe about each server, and
 * how that lines up with what the server is running as right now. It lives beside
 * the table rather than inside it because a verdict is not a control — folding it
 * into the stub column would read as a fifth switch — and it lives on this page
 * rather than under Connections because this is where the decision it informs is
 * made.
 *
 * Why the assessment is worth a screen even though it rarely says "share this":
 * a share recommendation requires the server to advertise the caller-identity
 * extension, which is a high bar almost nothing clears, so a column that only
 * showed "recommended / not recommended" would read as permanently broken. What
 * has content for every row is the REASON, plus the disagreement between the
 * verdict and the state the server is actually running in.
