/**
 * Is the "load earlier messages" control inside the transcript's viewport?
 *
 * FIRST-PRINCIPLES ADMISSION RULE for every AUTOMATIC older-history fetch. The
 * reader may only be paged backwards when the control that offers it is on their
 * screen. Manual activation (the click itself) is not subject to this.
 *
 * Why this replaces a pile of per-trigger guards: every automatic trigger in the
 * transcript keys off a proxy for "the reader wants history" — the mounted
 * window's start index, the scroller's height against the viewport's, a quiet
 * timer, a one-way input latch — and every one of those proxies has a second
 * cause that is not the reader. Measured on a real phone, in this order: a page
 * landing's own compensation write refreshing the quiet timer; a geometry
 * transient during a per-keystroke re-render; and the soft keyboard closing,
 * which grows the viewport by its whole height so the window extends upward and
 * walks `start` down across the lead with nobody travelling anywhere.
 *
 * The control's visibility has no second cause. It is at the head of the
 * transcript and it unmounts with the virtualized window, so it can only be on
 * screen when the reader has actually arrived at the top — and it subsumes the
 * special case the old geometry test needed, because a transcript too short to
 * scroll shows the control without anyone scrolling at all.
 *
 * Rects are passed in rather than read here so the rule itself is pure.
