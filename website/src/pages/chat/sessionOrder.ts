/**
 * How many local calendar days back an instant falls, seen from `now`.

 * `Date.UTC` projects the LOCAL calendar fields onto fixed-length UTC days, so
 * the result counts civil days rather than elapsed time. That is what makes it
 * survive DST: a local day is not always 86_400_000 ms long, but its
 * (year, month, date) triple is unambiguous, and both sides are projected the
 * same way. Negative for a future instant, which the caller folds into today.
 *
 * Deliberately stateless. An earlier revision of this file cached the
 * local-midnight instants and kept them honest with a growing set of validity
 * terms: the clock leaving the cached day in either direction, the zone
 * changing under it, and then the offset at each cached midnight moving
 * independently of the others. Each boundary added to such a cache needs its
 * own offset probe or it silently serves a label from a day that no longer
 * begins where it did. Deriving the day index per call retires that whole class
 * -- nothing is retained, so nothing can outlive the zone it was built in --
 * and measures cheaper than the guarded cache it replaces, because comparing
 * two day indices allocates no `Date` where re-probing three midnights did.
 * It is the shape the command palette's own relative-time formatter already uses.
