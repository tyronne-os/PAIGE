 * Whether two absolute paths name the SAME directory.

 * The rule is deliberately narrow: normalize ONLY what the filesystem itself
 * cannot distinguish. This gate decides which directory's tree the tab renders,
 * so the two error directions are not symmetric -- a false negative merely keeps
 * today's one-level listing, while a false positive renders ANOTHER directory's
 * tree under this tab's name and opens files from it. So:
 *
 * - A trailing slash never distinguishes a directory. Always ignored.
 * - Separator flavour is folded ONLY on a Windows gateway, where `\` and `/` are
 *   the same separator and a backslash cannot appear in a filename at all -- so
 *   folding it there can never alias two real directories. On POSIX a backslash
 *   IS an ordinary filename character, and folding it would make the real
 *   directory `/srv/a\b` compare equal to the different real directory
 *   `/srv/a/b`.
 * - Case is NEVER folded, on either platform. Windows is case-insensitive only
 *   by default: NTFS carries a per-directory case-sensitivity flag (set by WSL
 *   and by `fsutil file setCaseSensitiveInfo`), so two sibling directories
 *   differing only in case can both exist there. Folding case would alias them.
 *   Nothing produces a case-differing spelling of one directory here anyway --
 *   `projectDir` is the slot's server-resolved project and the tab path comes
 *   from a backend-confirmed listing, so both spellings originate from the same
 *   filesystem.
 *
 * The platform is the GATEWAY's, not the browser's: the filesystem that decides
 * what counts as one directory is the one the gateway serves.
 *
 * Deliberately string-only: this gate chooses which component renders, so it
 * must not depend on a request.

 * Directory listing as a side-panel tab body.
 *
 * Exists because a markdown path chip pointing at a directory used to open the
 * file viewer and report "file not found" — the path was real, it just wasn't a
 * file. A directory now gets an affordance that matches what it is.
 *
 * TWO BODIES, one tab. When the tab is rooted at the CURRENT CHAT's project
 * directory it renders the shared `PierreWorkspaceTree` — the same expandable
 * workspace tree the Files rail uses — so descending into a subdirectory expands
 * it in place, several branches can stay open at once, and the tab keeps naming
 * the project. Every other path keeps the one-level listing below, because
 * `/api/project/tree` deliberately answers only for server-known project roots
 * (403 `unknown_project_dir` otherwise) and a directory chip can point anywhere
 * on the gateway's filesystem. `useTreeState` decides availability off the tree
 * component's OWN query key, so the probe costs no extra request, and an error
 * there falls back to the listing rather than showing a dead panel.
 *
 * Navigation in listing mode is INTERNAL to the tab: clicking a subdirectory
 * re-targets this panel rather than spawning a tab per directory. `onPathChange`
 * lifts the new path back to the tab record so the strip label follows along. In
 * tree mode nothing re-targets while browsing descendants, so `onPathChange`
 * fires only for the parent row — which leaves the project root, and therefore
 * leaves tree mode, on purpose.
 *
 * Clicking a file hands off to `onFileOpen` in both modes, which opens a normal
 * file tab.
 *
 * Search is RECURSIVE and files-only in listing mode, which is why it is a second
 * request rather than a filter over `browseFiles`: that endpoint returns ONE
 * directory level, so filtering it client-side could only ever match what is
 * already on screen. `/api/file-search?project=<cwd>&kinds=files` walks the
 * subtree under its own scan budget and re-applies the sensitive-path refusal per
 * hit. In tree mode the same input feeds the tree's own search session instead:
 * the tree already holds the whole path set, so filtering is local and instant
 * and a second endpoint would be redundant.
