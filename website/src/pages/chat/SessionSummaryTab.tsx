/**
 * The session summary panel: a goal-level view of a session so returning to it
 * does not mean re-reading the transcript.
 *
 * Two ordering decisions carry the design, and both come from prototyping the
 * summary against real transcripts:
 *
 * - **Intents are ordered by last touched, descending** — not chronologically.
 *   Chronology is what a reader wants; recency is what a returning worker wants,
 *   and it buries the live intent at the bottom. Ordering by state also means a
 *   resumed intent simply rises, with no special case.
 * - **What needs the person is hoisted above the list**, across every intent, so
 *   "does this session need me?" is answered without scrolling.
 *
 * The panel never triggers generation — see `api.sessionSummary`.

                scroller's own flex sizing and stays IN FLOW: taking the scroller
                out of flow with `absolute` leaves the card no content to measure,
                and a card whose height is a `max-h` ceiling rather than a fixed
