 *     a mid-grey in both themes, so a dark screenshot separates from a dark
 *     card and a white one from a white card regardless of the border tokens.
 *   - Padding renders the background AROUND the content, so the plate is a

/**
 * The most recent prompt that has scrolled fully behind the band, pinned under
 * the session title.
 *
 * The card is a pixel-for-pixel copy of the user bubble's own box — same
 * `px-4 mx-auto` content column, right-aligned, `max-w-[550px]`, `px-4 py-2
 * rounded-xl bg-card text-sm` with an inner `my-1 leading-6` paragraph —
 * because the transcript row it represents is hidden while it is pinned (see
 * ChatPage's row `visibility`). For a one-line prompt the two are the same size
 * at the same place at the moment of hand-off, so the bubble appears to stop
 * travelling and stick rather than being replaced. A taller prompt hands over
 * once its bottom edge reaches the band's bottom (`pinHandoffY`), i.e. once it is
 * completely covered by the band, so the swap still happens out of sight. The
 * box also carries the bubble's `user-bubble` theme hook, so a theme that tints
 * the bubble (kiro-light) tints the card identically and the swap stays
 * invisible there too. Keep
 * these values in sync with `UserMessage`'s `bubble` and with `MD_COMPONENTS.p`
 * in MarkdownRenderer.
 *
 * Deliberate details that protect that equality:
 *   - No `border`. The bubble has none, so a 1px border made the card 2px taller
 *     and shifted its text 1px off the edge — the box visibly changed size as it
 *     pinned. The visible edge is an INSET RING (`ring-1 ring-inset forced-colors:border`) instead: it
 *     is painted as a box-shadow, so it reads as a 1px border at zero layout
 *     cost. Do not swap it back to `border-*`.
 *     Pair it with `shadow-sm`, NOT `shadow-md`: the `--shadow-md` token carries
 *     its own outset hairline (`0 0 0 1px`), which is 3% white in dark themes
 *     (invisible) but 4% black in light ones — one pixel outside our inset ring,
 *     so light mode rendered a visible DOUBLE border. `--shadow-sm` has no ring.
 *   - `items-start` on the band is LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic. The band's height
 *     is driven by the push (`ROW_PAD_Y * 2 + bannerH - pushUp` below) and the
 *     card is its flex item with no height of its own, so under the default
 *     `align-items: normal` the card is STRETCHED to whatever height the push
 *     leaves — and the card is the element ChatPage measures for `bannerH`. That
 *     closes a loop: pushing shrinks the band, the shrunk band shrinks the
 *     measured card, the smaller `bannerH` shrinks `pinPushTravel`, and the
 *     drop-when-cleared threshold fires against a moving target. Measured with
 *     the real class list: at pushUp 20 the 34.75px card reported 22.75px, and at
 *     full push it reported 0. `items-start` keeps the card at its natural height
 *     so the measurement is a fixed point.
 *   - The chevron takes its room from the TEXT, never from the box, and it only
 *     appears once the text is actually clamped. That gate is what keeps the
 *     box honest: a clamped line means the card has already hit its max width,
 *     so inserting the chevron cannot widen it — it only narrows the text
 *     further. A short prompt is unclamped, gets no chevron, and keeps hugging
 *     its text exactly like the bubble does. The two states are each stable, so
 *     the measurement below cannot oscillate: "overflowing at width W" still
 *     overflows at W minus the chevron.
 *   - Images are shown as thumbnails rather than dropped. `promptPreview` strips
 *     image markdown from the text, so a prompt whose entire content was an
 *     image used to pin as a blank card.
