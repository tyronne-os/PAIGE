/**
 * When the tabbed side panel must stay MOUNTED.
 *
 * An MCP App tab hosts a null-origin iframe (`sandbox="allow-scripts
 * allow-forms"`, no `allow-same-origin`) with no storage. Unmounting it reloads
 * the app and destroys whatever the user has drawn — there is nothing to restore
 * from. See `docs/architecture/dashboard-iframe-hosts.md`.
 *
 * An app-contributed tab (`contributes.panelTabs`) is the same class of loss for
 * a different reason: it mounts the app's bundle in-process through `AppHost`, so
 * an unmount discards the app component's own in-body state — an unsaved form, a
 * scroll position, an editor buffer — which nothing outside the component holds.
 *
 * The panel is normally render-gated on `activityOpen`, so closing it unmounts
 * the whole subtree. While such a tab is live we keep the subtree mounted and
 * hide it instead, matching the hide-not-unmount rule SidePanel already applies
 * to its own tab bodies and `InstancesViewport` applies to instance frames.
 *
 * With no app tab the behaviour is unchanged, which preserves the existing
 * width exit animation on close.

 *
 * Both axes appear in every target even though only one of them moves, and that
 * redundancy is the whole point. The wrapper has a STABLE React key, so flipping
 * the dock re-renders it rather than remounting it, and framer-motion does not
 * release a key that disappears from `animate`: it keeps owning the inline style
 * and holds the value it last resolved. Targeting one axis per dock therefore
 * left the flipped-away axis frozen at the size the OTHER dock gave it — a panel
 * sent to the bottom and brought back came home with the bottom row's height
 * (measured 850px -> 352px at a 900px viewport) pinned inline, and an inline
 * style outranks the `h-full` class that is supposed to size it. Naming the
 * cross axis keeps it under the animation's control at exactly the 100% its
 * class already asks for, so no axis is ever un-targeted and none can be frozen.
