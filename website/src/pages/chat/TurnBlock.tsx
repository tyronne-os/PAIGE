/**
 * Fold a turn's reasoning bursts into ONE `thinking` row, hoisted to the TURN
 * TOP.
 *
 * chatSlice opens a fresh `thinking` message per burst — one above every tool
 * step it explains (#4178). That keeps the live stream anchored correctly, but
 * a long agentic turn (a prepare-pr round, a monitor cycle) settles into a WALL
 * of a dozen-plus collapsed "Thought process" rows once the interleaved tool
 * calls fold away. This merges every content-bearing burst of the turn into a
 * single synthetic row.
 *
 * WHY TOP, not the first burst's slot: reasoning is client-only and never
 * persisted, so the `chat_done` slot refresh rebuilds the turn from server
 * history (which has no reasoning) and `mergePreservedThinking` re-inserts the
 * saved bursts. It anchors each burst on its FOLLOWING tool call (#4578/#4218),
 * which keeps the burst↔tool 1:1 case interleaved — but history holds ONE
 * assistant answer row for ALL bursts (segment flush is gated on pending text),
 * so any burst NOT followed by a distinct tool (trailing reasoning, or several
 * bursts collapsing onto that one answer row) falls back to the answer-text
 * anchor and lands at the TAIL, below the answer and its footer. Anchoring the
 * merged row at the first burst's position would therefore drop it below the
 * answer for exactly those turns. Pinning it to the turn top instead makes the
 * folded row's position independent of where the refresh parked the bursts:
 * live (interleaved) and reloaded (piled at the tail) both render one reasoning
 * row above the turn's output, matching the pre-#4178 single-block placement.
 *
 * The merge is render-only: the per-burst messages in the store are untouched,
 * so nothing downstream of the transcript (persistence, search idx, the live
 * accumulation in sseThinkingChunk) changes. The synthetic row reuses the first
 * burst's message object (and therefore its `clientTs`, so `messageRowKey` is
 * stable across renders) with the concatenated content, and keeps that burst's
 * `idx` so `renderItem`'s `renderMessage(idx, msg)` still keys it.
 *
 * Because the content GROWS as later bursts arrive (and as the open burst
 * streams), ThinkingBlock's content-growth liveness fires on the merged row too
 * — so a running turn shows ONE live "Thinking" line with the streaming tail
 * rather than sprouting a new row per burst, and it settles to a single
 * "Thought process" when the turn goes quiet. Empty placeholder `thinking` rows
 * (no content) are left in place, so a bare "Thinking…" placeholder is
 * unaffected; a single burst already sitting at the top is returned untouched.
