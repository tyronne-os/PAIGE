/**
 * Parsing for injected sub-agent completion events.
 *
 * When a sub-agent finishes, the gateway injects its result into the parent
 * session as the next turn's input (see gateway._subagent_done). That text is
 * written for the model: a `[Subagent completion event]` header, spawn-discipline
 * instructions ("do NOT re-run completed agents"), and either one agent's full
 * output or a whole wave's digest. Two shapes exist — the per-agent event and
 * the batch digest that replaces N per-agent turns once a wave exceeds the
 * digest chunk size.
 *
 * The header facts a card needs — outcome, tallies, chunk index, agent id — are
 * stamped as structured fields on the message's `meta.subagentCompletion` at
 * composition time (gateway._subagent_done, subagent.py). This module reads
 * those first (`fromMeta`); the header regexes below are a LEGACY-SCROLLBACK
 * fallback for rows persisted before the meta was stamped. That inversion is
 * the point of #1792: a reword of the gateway's prose can no longer silently
 * break card rendering, because no live consumer parses the prose — the regexes
 * only run when the structured meta is absent.
 *
 * Kept separate from SubagentCompletionCard so the transcript grouping pass can
 * ask "does this render as a card?" without pulling a React component (and its
 * markdown renderer) into a pure module.
