// unmounting, teleports everything above it by that many pixels.
//
// Easing the ROW's height instead of the scroll leaves the pin instant and
// spreads the same movement over ~13 frames, which reads as the content sliding.
// It rides the path streaming growth already uses — the ResizeObserver reports

// only ticks once a second, so a call that finishes before its first tick reads
// a meaningless "0s". The line therefore waits until the command has run this
// many seconds before it appears, and is removed the moment the command ends.
//
// This is also what keeps the transcript steady above a bottom-pinned reader: a
// status line that appears and then collapses moves everything above it by its
// own height, once per tool boundary. Short calls now add no line and remove
// none, so that step only ever happens at the end of a command that genuinely

//
// A collapsed row is a STATUS line, exactly like ThinkingBlock's folded
// "Thought process": it says which tool is running and that it is running, and
// nothing more. So the collapsed label is pinned to one line with an ellipsis
// and the full text lives one click away in ToolDetails, which already renders
// the verbatim input. Expanding restores wrapping — the user asked to see it.

          line unconditionally. The chip is `shrink-0` with its own 240px label
          cap while the pill's label is `min-w-0` shrinkable, so on a no-wrap row
          the chip takes its width first and the label lives on whatever is left
          — in a 358px column that left the pill 78px and stacked "Editing

          truncated name.
          The wrap is deliberately NOT gated on a viewport breakpoint. The
          starvation is a function of the COLUMN's width, and the column is not
          the viewport: `ChatPane` sets `--mc-content-width: 100%`, so a
          quarter-width pane in the session grid is a ~350px column at a 1440px
          viewport. Flex wrapping already keys on the space actually available,
          which is the same axis as the defect — a `md:` gate would have re-pinned
          exactly those panes to one row and let the ribbon back in.
          Wrapping also costs less than an unconditional column: a flex item
          wraps on its BASE size, so the common short row ("Reading the turn
          grouping" + TurnBlock.tsx) keeps its chip beside the label and only a
