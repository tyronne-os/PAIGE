 * `scrollerRef` and the host-maintained `displayItemsRef` (the list those
 * indices point into), so any host that can (a) mark its rows and (b) keep the
 * ref current can wear the banner. `pinFoldRef` is a zero-height sentinel the
 * host mounts on the fold line the banner sticks to (directly under its header,
 * or the scroller's own top edge when there is no header); `pinCardRef` goes on
 * the rendered `PinnedPrompt` card so the push geometry can measure it.
 *
 * Jumping back to the pinned prompt is host-specific — a virtualized transcript
 * must mount the target first, an unvirtualized one can glide straight to the
 * row — so the hook exposes `pinnedJumpChrome` (the landing inset, solved from
 * the live banner geometry) plus `jumpToPinnedPromptInPlace`, the unvirtualized
 * glide, and lets a virtualized host supply its own jump.
