 *  appended in one tick with the same `ts` — the exact hazard `msgIdentityKey`
 *  closes for group leads. Two rows sharing one key reach React as duplicate
 *  siblings (one is silently dropped from the DOM — content visibly missing)
 *  and share one HeightCache slot (each re-measure of either row reprices the
 *  other, oscillating the spacers). Same failure from an overlapping older
 *  page whose rows lack the `meta.mid` the prepend dedup keys on.
 *
 *  The tie-break is positional among COLLIDERS ONLY: the first occurrence
 *  keeps the bare key — so the common case is byte-identical to
 *  `virtualKeyFor` and every cached height, DOM node, and scroll anchor keyed
 *  before this pass survives — and each later duplicate gets an occurrence
 *  suffix. Deterministic for a given list order, so keys are stable across
 *  re-renders. An insert BEFORE a collider shifts which physical row holds
 *  the bare key: those rows remount (a `~#N` height or scroll anchor
 *  persisted under the old occupant can also go stale until re-measured) —
 *  bounded to rows that previously rendered broken (dropped sibling), and
 *  strictly better than that render.
 *
 *  NOT folded into `virtualKeyFor`: uniqueness is a property of the list, not
 *  of one row, and a per-row `~mid` suffix instead would rename every
