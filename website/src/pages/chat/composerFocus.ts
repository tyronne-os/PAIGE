 * Putting the caret in the chat composer after creating a session.

 * composer while a `createSlot` is still in flight puts the caret on the OLD
 * session, so anything the user types in that window becomes the old slot's
 * draft and is lost the moment the new slot activates. Slow creation makes the
 * window real rather than theoretical.
 *
 * The session-grid split view breaks the one-composer assumption: each
 * `ChatPane` mounts its own composer, so N composers coexist and a
 * document-global first-match lookup would always land on the first pane.
 * `queryComposer` therefore scopes the lookup to the pane holding focus.

 *  1. The composer inside the pane that currently holds focus — the
 *     `[data-chat-pane]` ancestor of `document.activeElement`. In the split
 *     view every pane mounts its own composer, and a global shortcut must act
 *     on the pane the user is working in, not the first pane in document
 *     order.
 *  2. The composer inside the grid-focused pane (`[data-chat-pane="focused"]`).
 *     The pane's pickers render through portals under `document.body`, so
 *     while one is open the active element has NO pane ancestor — the grid's
 *     own focused-pane marker is what still names the pane the user is in.
 *  3. Document-wide fallback, which preserves single-pane behaviour: with one
 *     composer on the page (or focus outside any pane in a view with no
 *     focused marker) the first match IS the right one.
 *
 * The probe is the stable `data-composer-input` hook, NOT the textarea's
 * aria-label: the label is `i18nT('components.chatInput.message_input')` and
 * every catalog translates it, so a label-based selector matches in English
 * only and focus silently no-ops in the other eleven languages. The `data-`
 * attribute is invisible to assistive tech and never translated, which leaves
 * the label free to localize.
 *
 * Steps 1 and 2 are `focusedPane()` below, shared with the pending-approval
 * lookup so both chords agree about which pane they are in.
