/**
 * Arrow-key roving for the sidebar session rows.
 *
 * Each keyboard-focusable session row carries `data-session-row="<slot key>"`
 * and `data-session-scope="<render scope>"`. The scope is what bounds a rove:
 * the sidebar renders the same slot in more than one place (the folder list,
 * the flat list, one board column per tag), so ArrowDown has to walk the list
 * the focused row actually sits in instead of jumping between them. Scope is
 * compared through `dataset` rather than baked into the selector because a
 * board scope is a column id, which is not guaranteed to be selector-safe.
 *
 * The rove moves FOCUS only — Enter/Space on a row still switches to it — so a
 * keyboard user can read down the list without loading every session on the way.

 * Every row rendered in the same scope as `row`, in DOM order, minus the ones

 *
 * A collapsed folder still renders its rows — `FolderBody` keeps them mounted
 * and suppresses them with `inert` + `visibility: hidden` (and, once the
 * collapse has finished animating, `content-visibility: hidden`) rather than
 * unmounting, so the collapse can animate to intrinsic height and the settled
 * state reserves no scroll height. Those rows are unfocusable, so leaving them
 * in would stall the rove on an invisible row instead of carrying on to the next
 * visible session. `row` itself is always kept so the caller's `indexOf` holds.
