// but as its own change.
//
// The comparison is also local, because the hook's direction model negates by

 * LOGARITHMIC, because the measured data makes a linear axis useless. The gateway
 * request histogram runs min 0ms, p50 2ms, p90 228ms, max 213.7s — a max a
 * thousand times p90 — so on a linear scale both percentiles land inside the
 * leftmost 0.1% of the bar and every row renders as one indistinguishable sliver.
 * A log axis is how a latency distribution is read for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Normalised PER ROW as well: these instruments span four orders of magnitude
 * between them, so one shared axis would flatten the fast ones against the
 * slowest. Each bar therefore answers "how long is THIS one's tail"; the numbers
 * beside it stay comparable across rows.
 *
 * A zero minimum has no logarithm, so the axis starts at a sub-millisecond floor
 * rather than at zero. That is a floor on the AXIS, not a claim about the data —
 * the real min is printed next to the bar.

// ── Context ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Rows are the per-session occupancy samples the API has always returned and
 * the page never rendered: `context.sessions[]` was computed, serialised and
 * dropped on the floor, so the only way to see which conversation was near
 * compaction was to read the spend ranking and hope the two windows agreed.
 */
/**
 * What a Context row calls itself, given the spend row it joined (or none).
 *
 * Three outcomes, in the order the reader benefits from: the conversation's title;
 * the dated "untitled conversation" wording Spend already uses when a joined row has
 * no title (a title exists only while a conversation is open, so a closed one joins
 * and still has nothing to show); and the raw slot when nothing joined at all, which
 * is the only case with no conversation record to name.
 *
 * The middle case matters for cross-tab reading: the same conversation read
 * "Untitled conversation on <date>" in Spend and a bare slot here, so its rows could
 * not be matched between the two tabs. It needs no new copy - the key exists.
 */
/**
 * Whether a conversation row should render as a link to the conversation.
 *
 * TWO conditions, not one, and the rule lives here rather than in each cell
 * because both tables ask it and a silent divergence between them is exactly the
 * cross-tab inconsistency this column set is trying to remove.
 *
 * A title alone is not enough: ChatPage resolves `?sid` against the live
 * DASHBOARD slot list, so a Telegram thread -- a real conversation, often titled
 * -- would render as a link that lands on `Session "..." not found` after a 5s
 * timeout. And a dashboard row with no title is untitled BECAUSE its slot is
 * gone, so it has nothing to resolve either.
 *
 * The `!!navigable` guard makes it fail CLOSED: without it a payload missing
 * `navigable_category` would satisfy the comparison for every row that also has
 * no category, and link all of them.
