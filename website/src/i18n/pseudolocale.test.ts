/**
 * The pseudolocale must be resolvable but not selectable.
 *
 * `en-XA` has to be a registered language: `resolveLanguage()` falls back on the primary
 * subtag, so an unregistered `en-XA` silently collapses to `en` and the pseudolocale
 * never activates. But a user of a shipped build must not be able to select a UI where
 * every string is accented and padded.
 *
 * That leaves exactly one failure mode — a botched environment check leaking it into
 * production — so this asserts the complement rather than trusting the check: in a
 * production build the picker offers every registered language *except* the dev-only
 * ones, and the count is asserted, not just the absence.
 *
 * Also guarded here: registering a pseudolocale must not perturb real-language
 * detection. A pseudolocale sharing the `en` primary subtag gives `en` two
 * candidates, which would make `matchConfident()` treat `en-GB` as ambiguous and
 * stop resolving it to `en`. Browser detection therefore reads `DETECTABLE_CODES`,
 * and these tests pin that separation.
