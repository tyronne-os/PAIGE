/**
 * The pseudolocale catalog must not ship in a production bundle.
 *
 * `en-XA` is a mechanical accent-and-pad transform of the whole English catalog
 * — the largest single catalog in the app (~88 KB gzip) — and it is already
 * unreachable in production: `devOnly` keeps it out of the picker and
 * `isRestorableLanguage()` refuses it from persisted state. Registering it
 * unconditionally would therefore cost every production user a catalog none of
 * them can select.
 *
 * `import.meta.env.DEV` is true under vitest, so the production branch is
 * STUBBED and the module re-evaluated rather than merely asserted around: an
 * `if (DEV)`-shaped test would only ever exercise its dev half in CI and would
 * pass just as happily against the unfixed code. This mirrors the stubbing in
 * `pseudolocale.test.ts`.
