/**
 * The framed send-failed string is core-owned — a drift guard for issue #4240.
 *
 * ## The defect this guard closes
 *
 * The refused-send error rows (#4198) framed the server reason with
 * `apps.designTweak.status.send_failed` because it was the only framed variant
 * in the catalog. That made core chrome depend on an APP's catalog namespace:
 * an app-side string edit could silently reword core error rows. The entry is
 * now promoted to `pages.chatPage.send_failed_with_error` (a sibling of the
 * unframed `pages.chatPage.send_failed` that ChatPage already uses), and the
 * app key is deleted.
 *
 * Two invariants, each of which failed silently before:
 *
 * 1. The shared key exists in EVERY locale catalog and carries the `{{error}}`
 *    placeholder. i18next renders a missing key as the key string itself, so a
 *    locale that lost the entry would ship
 *    `pages.chatPage.send_failed_with_error` as visible UI text.
 * 2. No source file references the retired app-namespace key. A call site that
 *    reaches for `apps.designTweak.status.send_failed` re-creates the
 *    core-depends-on-app coupling this move removed — and, now that the entry
 *    is deleted, renders the raw key.
