/**
 * The untranslated-string gate's two comparisons, tested directly.
 *
 * `check-i18n-strings.mjs` runs eslint over ~540 source files before it compares
 * anything, so its logic has no cheap coverage from the outside — which is exactly why
 * the direction of a comparison, or a wrong path prefix, can change without a test
 * noticing. Two contracts are asserted here:
 *
 *   - `diffAgainstBaseline` — the ASYMMETRY. Growth fails; improvement does not force an
 *     edit. That is a deliberate loosening, and a loosening with no test is
 *     indistinguishable from a bug.
 *   - `parseAddedLines` + `findingsOnAddedLines` — the STRICT half. A literal on a line
 *     the branch wrote fails with no baseline to raise. Its failure mode is silent: a
 *     wrong prefix or a missed hunk shape reports zero findings forever and reads as
 *     "clean", so the cases it breaks on are pinned here.
 *
 * All three functions are pure, so these cases cost nothing.
