/**
 * Formatting must consult the app's language, not the browser's.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * `d.toLocaleDateString()`, `d.toLocaleDateString([])` and
 * `d.toLocaleTimeString(undefined, { … })` all mean the same thing: format in the
 * **host** locale. They ignore `dashboard.language` entirely. `LanguageProvider`
 * sets `<html lang>`, but `<html lang>` has no effect on `Intl`, so a dashboard
 * running in Chinese on an en-US browser rendered `7/30/2026` and `Jul 30` inside
 * Chinese UI. `a.localeCompare(b)` has the same flaw for ordering: the sort order
 * of a list of names silently depended on the browser.
 *
 * The fix is `src/i18n/format.ts`, which reads the active language per call.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A `toLocale*` / `localeCompare` call is a finding when it does **not** say
 * which locale it means:
 *
 *   - `x.toLocaleString()` / `(([]))` / `(undefined, opts)`  → finding
 *   - `a.localeCompare(b)`                                   → finding
 *   - `x.toLocaleDateString('en-US', opts)`                  → allowed
 *   - `a.localeCompare(b, 'en-US')`                          → allowed
 *
 * Naming a locale IS the opt-out, which is why there is no allowlist file. That
 * is deliberate: a machine-parse site — an ISO timestamp sort, a filesystem path
 * sort, a value fed to `Date.parse` on the other side — has to state its pin in
 * the code where a reviewer sees it, rather than in a registry a reviewer has to
 * go and look up. Byte-order comparison (`a < b ? -1 : 1`) is the other correct
 * answer for those, and is not matched by this gate at all.
 *
 * ## Why an upward-only ceiling plus two diff-scoped gates
 *
 * There were ~100 such calls when this gate landed. The seam and the shared
 * helpers migrated first, because a helper fixes every consumer at once; the
 * long tail migrates in later batches.
 *
 * The ceiling is upward-only rather than failing in both directions: a
 * downward half does not keep a budget shrinking. A stored count is regenerated
 * by one command, so the downward half only ever costs a ledger hunk that reads
 * like routine churn, while every parallel i18n branch has to edit the same line
 * and conflict. The upward-only model, which is strictly stronger:
 *
 *   - `BASELINE` is a CEILING (`toBeLessThanOrEqual`). Going up fails. Going
 *     down is free and needs no commit, so a branch that migrates twenty call
 *     sites does not also have to touch a number three other branches are
 *     editing.
 *   - `[added-lines]` — a host-locale call on a line THIS BRANCH WROTE fails,
 *     with no exemption and no number to regenerate.
 *   - `[vs-base]` — a file this branch TOUCHED holding more host-locale calls
 *     than it did at the base ref fails, which catches a call added on a line
 *     the diff attributes to context.
 *
 * Both diff-scoped gates store nothing: they read the base ref out of git, which
 * already holds yesterday's number. They are skipped, loudly, only when
 * `I18N_BASE_REF` is unset — a bare local run. CI always supplies it: the base
 * branch on a PR, and the commit the push replaced on a push to `main`.
 *
 * When the ceiling reaches 0, delete it and assert `[]` directly, which is the
 * phase's stated acceptance gate ("zero bare `toLocale*`/`localeCompare` outside
 * `format.ts`").
 *
 * ## Known false negatives, stated explicitly
 *
 *  1. **Indirection.** `const f = d.toLocaleDateString; f()` is not matched. No
 *     such site exists; the pattern is unnatural in this codebase.
 *  2. **A pinned locale can still be the WRONG locale.** This gate proves a
 *     locale was chosen, not that it was chosen correctly. `toLocaleString('en-US')`
 *     on a user-facing date passes here and is still a bug — that is what review
 *     and the render-time gate in Phase 5 are for.
 *  3. **`Intl.*` constructed directly** with a hardcoded locale outside
 *     `format.ts` is not matched. `utils/tz.ts` legitimately does this to derive
 *     cron day-of-week numbers, and the pin there is load-bearing.
 *  4. **`toFixed` / `String(n)` / `join(', ')`** are outside this gate's scope.
 *     They are not locale-aware APIs at all, so there is nothing syntactic to
 *     detect; they are tracked by the phase plan, not by a matcher.
 *  5. **Hand-rolled clock and duration strings** — `h.padStart(2,'0') + ':00'`,
 *     `` `${m}m ${s}s` `` — call no locale-aware API, so nothing here can see
 *     them. `unitLiterals.test.ts` is the gate for that shape.
