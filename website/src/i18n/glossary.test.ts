/**
 * Do-not-translate (DNT) gate.
 *
 * Product names must survive translation verbatim. This test reads the `dnt` array from
 * `glossary.json` and fails when a translation drops a proper noun that is present in
 * the English source.
 *
 * The list is proper nouns only: abbreviations like PR, CR, API, CLI, URL are deliberately
 * absent because they behave as common nouns and inflect — Russian declines PR to
 * "пул-реквеста", which is correct translation, not a dropped term.
 *
 * 36 existing violations are baselined. They are the same six English keys repeated across
 * five languages (systematic cause: codemod sentence splitting placed the name at a
 * fragment boundary). Whether dropping a name is acceptable is a per-language judgement
 * for a reader, so it is ratcheted rather than fixed blind.
