/**
 * Translation keys must be literals, so that tooling can see them.
 *
 * A key assembled at runtime — `i18nT(prefix + name)`, `` i18nT(`nav.${id}`) `` —
 * is invisible to every static tool in the ecosystem. Extractors do not find it,
 * unused-key linters report it as dead, and a pruning pass deletes it. The failure
 * is then silent at the call site, because i18next returns the key string itself
 * rather than throwing: the UI shows `pages.settings.aboutPanel.update_error_offline`
 * where a sentence should be.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. `AboutPanel.tsx` carries a comment recording a
 * missing key taking the whole Settings panel down through the error boundary.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Every `i18nT()` first argument is a string literal, with one allowlisted
 * exception documented below. The industry answer to a dynamic key is *don't
 * construct one* — write an `as const` map from your enum to full literal keys and
 * index it. Tooling then sees ordinary literals, and the lookup stays one
 * expression. `AboutPanel`'s `UPDATE_ERROR_KEYS` is the worked example.
 *
 * ## Why a test and not an ESLint rule
 *
 * Same reach, no new plugin infrastructure, and it matches what this suite already
 * does elsewhere — `englishIdentity.test.ts` reads codemod source for the same
 * kind of assertion. If this grows more rules it should graduate to a local
 * ESLint plugin; one rule does not justify one.
