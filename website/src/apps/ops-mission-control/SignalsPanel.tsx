/**
 * SignalsPanel — the Signals tab.
 *
 * The Signals rail used to be a 280px column beside the Board, which made it a
 * status readout and nothing more: no room to show what a source last returned, no
 * way to see a signal the heartbeat has NOT claimed yet, and no way to act on one.
 * Splitting it out gives signal configuration real space and hands the Board its
 * full width back.
 *
 * What this surface answers that the rail could not:
 *
 * - Which sources are wired, and which are silently unconfigured.
 * - What each source returned on the LAST poll, including its error text. A
 *   provider whose credentials expired reports "ready" from config alone; only a
 *   real poll shows the failure.
 * - Whether a quiet board can be TRUSTED (`all_sources_healthy`). Absence of a signal
 *   means "it cleared" only for a source whose poll succeeded.
 * - Which firing signals are NOT yet incidents. Under the claim cap (3/cycle) an
 *   alarm storm legitimately leaves a queue, and before this the remainder was a
 *   number with no detail — you could see "12 remaining" but not what they were.
 * - Claim one now, rather than waiting for the next heartbeat.

            refuses to re-derive them (`record_use` binds the provider key on match, so from
            occurrence two onward every shape match would render as exact). This claim
            response is the ONLY place either is observable, which is exactly why both were
            declared in api.ts and read by nothing.

            The distinction is the operator's, not a detail: an exact match came from the
            provider's own identity, while a shape match came from a hash over rendered text
            with bare digits stripped — which provably over-merges a 4xx and a 5xx alarm on
            one resource. `fast_path` says whether the agent will propose the remembered fix
            directly, so it is the difference between reading the incident and checking it. */}
