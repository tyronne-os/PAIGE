/**
 * AWS Control - the cloud drive, as its own page.
 *
 * Reached from the Cloud drive capability row on the account console; a
 * breadcrumb returns. Like the console it is view state inside `AwsControlPage`
 * rather than a route of its own, because `BuiltinAppRoute` resolves only
 * single-segment routes.
 *
 * One bucket holds three sections behind their own prefixes - the artifact
 * library, the file drive, and backups - and this page is where all three live,
 * together with the share ledger that governs links into them. They were four
 * stacked sections on the account console; that page now carries one row saying
 * the drive exists, and everything about its CONTENTS is here.
 *
 * The file listing renders through the shared library table header
 * (`components/library/LibraryTable`), declaring its own columns: an S3 object
 * has no slug, kind, source, version or tags, so the artifact library's nine
 * columns would have to be invented for it. What IS shared is the header chrome
 * - the sort control and the pinned Actions cell with its measured seam - which
 * is the part that is subtle and expensive to keep in sync by hand.
 *
 * Every mutation is confirmed before it runs and ends by invalidating its
 * react-query key. All AWS access runs through the gateway's audited CLI
 * chokepoint; this surface never talks to AWS from the browser.

     Both halves of that are load-bearing. The listing's rows come from
     `driveList`, so a row IS a cloud folder and removing its slug empties the
     object the reader was shown -- identity by construction. The picker beside
     it cannot say that: its rows are local artifacts joined to a slug-keyed
     ledger, so a reused slug lends a never-pushed artifact another one's push
     record and a removal there empties a DIFFERENT artifact's copy (#6987).

     Holding `confirmSlug` at the section makes only one confirm openable at a
     time and, more importantly, leaves nowhere for a per-card confirm flag to
     go stale: a card exists exactly while its object is listed, and a
     successful removal invalidates the listing, so the card and its strip
     unmount together. What keeps one row's outcome off another row is NOT this

     One `useMutation` is right for FIRING the request. What cannot work is any
     single slot owning per-card state, and three rounds of this PR each fixed one
     more layer of that same mistake instead of the shape:
     
       1. `confirmSlug` cleared unconditionally, so a completing removal closed a
          different card's confirm. Fixed with the ownership guard below.
       2. `removeMut.reset()` on open threw away an in-flight removal's state, so
          a failure had nowhere to report. Fixed by keying the failure to a slug.
       3. that key was itself ONE slug, so of two overlapping failures the later
          hid the earlier -- and the observer's own pending flag is likewise one
          boolean, with its `variables` holding only the most recent slug, so a
          "Removing" label and a disabled Cancel could light up on a card nothing
          is happening to.
     
     Layers 1-3 are all the same defect: per-card state held in a value shared
     across cards. N cards need N slots, so these are sets and every per-card
     indicator is derived from membership. Nothing per-card reads a shared value,
     which is why there is no layer four to find. The check is mechanical: the
     only member this section reads off the mutation observer is `.mutate`, so
     `grep 'removeMut\.'` returns that call and this paragraph, nothing else.
     
     This is also the shape the picker 600 lines below has always used for its own
     per-card push state (`addingSlugs` / `failedSlugs`); the regression was mine,
     in moving the affordance without carrying that lesson across.
     
     `confirmSlug` stays a scalar deliberately: only one confirm strip is open at a

     whose identity this machine cannot vouch for, same treatment as one with no
     local copy at all. That loses a name we might have guessed right, which is
     the correct trade against naming it wrong. The cause-level fix is reading
     the pushed meta.json sidecar instead of inferring from local state (#6987).

     READ THE SCOPE OF THIS GATE LITERALLY, because it is narrower than it
     sounds. `pushedAt` is `pushed.get("pushedAt")` in `list_pushable`, read from
     a ledger keyed `account -> slug`, and `ArtifactStore.delete` never prunes it.
     So the gate excludes an artifact with NO record under its slug -- the
     cross-machine "notes"/"readme" collision above -- and does NOT exclude one
     that INHERITED a record from a deleted predecessor: push A, delete A
     locally, create B on A's slug, and B reads A's `pushedAt`, passes here, and
     lends its name to A's object. No ledger-derived field can separate those two
     (`pushedVersion` and a `synced` flag are contaminated identically), which is
     why the fix is the sidecar and not a better predicate here. */

     neither name, kind nor preview from a copy that does exist. A pending or
     failed lookup is not the answer "there is no local copy", so nothing may be
     concluded from a miss until this is true.

     It gates only what a card CLAIMS, never whether it can be removed. Removal
     targets the slug this listing returned, which is in the bucket whatever the

                could only ever reach local artifacts, so a copy from elsewhere
                was unremovable while a locally reused slug could remove the
                wrong one -- exactly backwards from what the spec asks of a
                console "that must be able to remove it". Nothing here is gated
                on local state, because the object's presence in this listing is
                not. */}

                against the picker rather than an oversight. A row here exists if
                and only if `artifacts/<slug>/` is in the bucket -- the listing
                enumerates the prefix -- so the removal empties exactly the
                object that was observed, never an object inferred from the
                ledger. On the picker the row IS a local artifact and no cloud
                object has been observed at all, so there the target would be a
                ledger inference; that surface gets no removal, pinned by its own
                test.

                What is NOT settled here, and must not be read into the above:
                WHOSE copy this is. `local` comes from a ledger keyed
                `account -> slug`, so a later artifact that reuses the slug
                inherits the earlier one's push record and lends this card its
                label. The confirm cannot resolve it either -- the folder name is
                built from that same shared slug, so it reads identically for
                both artifacts. So the delete target is correct and the DISPLAYED
                IDENTITY may belong to a different artifact, on an irreversible
                action. Proving identity requires the pushed `meta.json` sidecar
                and is #6987's; this placement neither introduces that hole nor
                closes it (main offers the same slug-targeted removal from
                `PickerCard`). Do not "fix" it by hiding this item when `local`
                is defined: that is the common case, the picker's removal is gone
                in this change, and the two together would leave no way to remove
                a cloud copy at all. */}

  /* NO removal control here, deliberately, and this is the defect the change
     fixes rather than an omission.

     This card is a LOCAL artifact joined to a ledger keyed `account -> slug`.
     `ArtifactStore.delete` does not prune that ledger, and a new artifact starts
     at version 1 -- so pushing A, deleting A locally and creating a B that takes
     A's slug leaves B's card wearing A's push record. A removal offered here
     would empty `artifacts/<slug>/`, which is A's copy, under B's name. No
     predicate available on this card can tell the two apart: `synced` is the
     inherited record itself, and `pushedVersion === version` is satisfied by a
     never-pushed B at v1 against A's pushed v1. Naming the folder in the confirm
     narrows the blast radius but cannot fix it -- the reader is still being asked
     to vouch for an identity this machine cannot establish.

     Removal therefore belongs to the Library folder behind this dialog, whose
     rows come from the bucket listing, so removing one empties the object that
     was LISTED instead of one the ledger merely implies. That is a better
     TARGET, not a proof of ownership: the label there is still the slug-keyed
     join, and the confirm's folder name is built from the same shared slug, so
     neither can separate two artifacts that took turns holding it. Until #6987
     reads the pushed meta.json sidecar, no surface can. What the move buys is
     that the object being emptied is one the bucket actually reported, and that
     a cloud copy with no local row at all becomes reachable. */

                version matches. Disabling on `upToDate` then removed the only way
                to put the copy back, and this page makes that contradiction
                visible for the first time: the Library folder lists the real
                prefix, so it shows the object GONE while the picker insisted it
                was up to date. A same-version push is idempotent (it rewrites the
                same key plus its sidecar), so the worst case is one redundant
                upload and the best case is recovering a copy you cannot
                otherwise restore.

                Neither the backend reconcile nor Remove makes the door safe to
                lock. Reconcile is slug-granular: it prunes a record only when the
                WHOLE `artifacts/<slug>/` prefix is absent, so a copy that lost
                its content key but kept its sidecar still lists as present and
                still reads as up to date. And Remove empties the prefix -- it
                never puts the content back, so it is not the restore path a
                disabled Push would need. */}
