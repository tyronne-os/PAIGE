// Resumable chat sessions for auto-improvement subjects (pull requests,
// findings, the ruler, a run).
//
// The app this was ported from had exactly ONE chat affordance:
// `useChatLauncher().openChat({message})`, which always started a brand-new
// session and returned nothing. Clicking "Discuss this CR" twice gave you two
// unrelated conversations and no way back to the first, so context was lost
// every time.
//
// Here each subject gets a DURABLE session link: the slot key is persisted by
// the app backend (PUT /api/apps/auto-improvement/sessions/<key>), so a repeat
// click RESUMES the same conversation. Sessions are filed into one chat folder
// per repository, which keeps a night's run from scattering loose sessions
// through the sidebar.
//
// Deliberately self-contained and touching no core files: a first-party app runs
// inside the dashboard bundle, so it can dispatch the same Redux thunks and call
// the same `api` chat primitives the dashboard's own "New Chat" uses. Established
// precedent: issue-radar, file-explorer, and auto-research all import the store
// and api client directly.
