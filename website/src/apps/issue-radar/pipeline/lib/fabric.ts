// the per-phase dwell. No React, no DOM, no timers — every function here takes

// testable without a render. Wave 2 changes only the PRESENTATION on top of this.
//
// The SERVER already did the phase-recording fold and hands us `phase` (live,
// authoritative), `timeline` (time order, may repeat a phase) and `exit`. So this
// layer re-derives only the DRAWING facts, and — per PLAN.md's design decisions —
// must not second-guess the live phase:
//
//   1. Columns are the ON-SPINE phase enum. `resolved` is the only terminal on
//      the spine; the four other terminals and `awaiting-reply` are EXITS drawn
//      off the lane, never columns (a column would imply a skipped item got
//      further than a claimed one).
//   2. The head is the item's LIVE `phase`, not `timeline`'s max index. A review
//      round-trip ends LEFT of where it has been.
//   3. An open dwell is measured from the item's MOST RECENT entry into its
//      current phase, because re-entering a phase restarts its clock.

// REPO RESOLUTION — pure, so the "which repo does a first-ever visit show"
// decision is unit-testable without a render. localStorage is a REMEMBERED
// PREFERENCE, never the source of truth: the backend's connected-repo list is
// authoritative, so a preference that names a repo no longer connected is stale
// and falls back to a deterministic default (first by a stable order, not by
// chance). This is what lets the app stand alone — it no longer needs a prior
// visit to Issue Radar to know which repo to show.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// This module holds no repository-SELECTION helpers, because the
// picker they served: `withDefaults`, `repoOrderKey`, `sameRepo`, `toRef` and
// `selectRepo` existed to pick a repository from a connected list and a
// remembered preference. The pipeline is a dashboard inside Issue Radar now and
// is handed the active repository, so there is nothing left to select.
