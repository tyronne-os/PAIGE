/** Provider-aware links and display vocabulary.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in `api.ts`: these are pure functions of a `RepoRef`, with no
 * network involved, and tests that mock the api client to control fetching must
 * not simultaneously lose the ability to build a URL. Keeping them here means
 * `vi.mock('../api')` stubs the transport and nothing else.
 *
 * The whole point of routing every link through here is that the providers do
 * NOT share a URL grammar — GitLab nests a project's own pages under `/-/`,
 * Azure DevOps puts a literal `_git` between the project and the repository and
 * addresses work items off the PROJECT with no repository dimension at all, and
 * a self-managed instance is not even on the same host. Concatenating onto
 * `https://github.com/…` produces a link that silently points at a stranger's
 * repo on the public site.
 *
 * ## Why a descriptor TABLE and not a boolean
 *
 * Every builder below used to branch on `isGitlab(ref)`. A boolean has exactly
 * two arms, so the moment a third provider exists it cannot express it: Azure
 * DevOps would take whichever arm it is not, inheriting GitHub's URL shape (no
 * `_git`, work items under `/issues/`) with no error to notice — a link that
 * resolves to a 404, or worse to somebody else's page. The table has one row per
 * provider id, so adding a provider is a row rather than an edit to ~10 branches,
 * and a row that forgets a field fails to compile.
