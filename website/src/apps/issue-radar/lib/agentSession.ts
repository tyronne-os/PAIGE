// Shared "open an agent chat session for one GitHub item" orchestration, used
// by BOTH the issue Investigate action (lib/investigate.ts) and the pull-request
// Review action (lib/review.ts). Only the seed PROMPT and the slot TITLE differ
// between the two; every other step — resolve the per-repo chat folder, create a
// slot filed into it and already titled, seed + auto-run the first turn, link the
// local record so a repeat click RESUMES instead of duplicating, navigate to
// /chat — is identical, so it lives here once.
//
// This deliberately FORKS NOTHING — a first-party app runs inside the dashboard
// bundle, so it dispatches the same Redux thunks (`createSlot`, `switchSlot`) and
// calls the same `api` chat primitives the dashboard's own "New Chat" uses
// (verified precedents: file-explorer / auto-research import the store + api
// client directly). Where a primitive is missing something this flow needs, the
// fix belongs in that primitive rather than in a private copy here.
//
// The per-item record is the SAME store on both sides
// (via /api/apps/issue-radar/investigation), NAMESPACED by item kind. On GitHub
// the namespace is shared and the filename keeps its
// ``investigation-{number}.json`` form: issues and pull requests are drawn from
// ONE number sequence per repo, so they cannot collide. GitLab numbers them
// independently — issue ``#5`` and merge request ``!5`` are unrelated items — so a
// change request passes ``kind: 'pull'`` and gets its own record. Omitting it
// there would make "Review MR !5" resume issue #5's session and overwrite its
// findings.
