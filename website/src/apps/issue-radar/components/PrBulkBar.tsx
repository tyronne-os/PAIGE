// The bulk-action bar that appears above the PR list once rows are ticked.
//
// Mass triage: approve, comment, close/reopen, or arm the provider's own
// auto-merge across a selection. It is the same action set as the per-PR bar minus
// "request changes", which is per-PR only — a mass change-request without per-PR
// reasoning is not feedback anyone can act on, and the server's allowlist agrees.
//
// Two properties worth stating, because they are what make a mass mutation safe to
// offer at all:
//
//  * **A destructive or hard-to-undo action requires a typed confirmation.**
//    Closing N pull requests is the one action here whose blast radius is real
//    (each close is a separate notification to a separate author), so it arms only
//    when the user types the confirm token — the same pattern SchedulePage uses for
//    bulk delete. Approving is reversible, commenting is additive, and arming
//    auto-merge is reversible AND leaves the provider deciding each one, so those
//    apply directly. Note the last claim is only true because the GitLab client
//    refuses to arm when no pipeline is in flight: there, the arm flag rides on the
//    merge endpoint and would otherwise merge immediately, which is exactly the
//    irreversible mass action this confirmation policy exists to prevent. Merging
//    itself is absent from this bar for the same reason.
//  * **Partial failure is REPORTED, not thrown away.** A batch where one PR was
//    locked and nine succeeded shows exactly that, per PR. Silently reporting "done"
//    would leave the user believing a write happened that did not.
