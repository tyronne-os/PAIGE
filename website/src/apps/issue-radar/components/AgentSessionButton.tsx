  //
  // WHY A POPOVER RATHER THAN A LINE IN THE ROW
  //
  // The reason used to live only in this button's `title` plus an `sr-only` live
  // region. Between them those serve a hovering mouse user and a screen-reader
  // user; a sighted KEYBOARD user is in neither group (browsers surface `title` on
  // hover, not on focus) and a touch user cannot surface a `title` at all — which
  // is the population a declined click leaves with no explanation whatsoever.
  //
  // Two earlier attempts put the sentence in the toolbar row and both were
  // correctly blocked. The constraint is narrower than "buttons only" — this very
  // component already renders inline text for its error branch — it is WRAPPING:
  // the group is `flex-shrink-0 flex items-stretch` (`DetailHeader.tsx`), so a
  // sibling that wraps stretches the button to its height, and this sentence wraps
  // at 320px (`website/docs/narrow-viewport.md`: "verify at 320px"). A popover is
  // portalled OUT of that flex row, so neither the wrapping nor the stretching
  // applies and the constraint does not reach it.

  // Dismissal is local, so Escape or a click outside closes the notice without
