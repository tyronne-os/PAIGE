/**
 * Icon names an APP may name in its manifest.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from `builtinIcons.tsx`. That registry is seeded by core
 * and extended only through `registerBuiltinIcons()`, which its own header
 * documents as read at module-load during edition composition — so a
 * runtime-installed app can never register into it, and resolving a manifest icon
 * through it would silently render the fallback for every app that is not part of
 * the build. This map is the app-reachable counterpart: a fixed, documented set
 * that any installed app can name without registering anything.
 *
 * Bounded rather than a lookup over lucide's full export on purpose: the whole
 * icon set is ~1k components, and importing it to resolve one manifest string
 * would put all of them in the bundle. Names are PascalCase, matching the
 * `lucide-react` component names and `ui.pages[].icon`.
 *
 * The set is documented in `docs/app-kit/manifest-reference.md`; adding a name
 * here is what widens it, and the doc table must move in the same commit.
