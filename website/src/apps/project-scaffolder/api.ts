/**
 * Typed client for the two host folder-scaffolding endpoints.
 *
 * App-local rather than a pair of methods on the shared `api/client.ts` for one
 * reason: this surface has to read the `code` out of a 400 body, and the shared
 * client's `j()` collapses a failure into an `Error` whose message is the
 * advisory prose. `code` is the contract the UI branches on (a stale selection
 * needs a re-scan prompt, an unusable root needs an inline field error), so it
 * has to survive the throw.
 *
 * There is no scan or create logic here, deliberately. The server re-derives the
 * selection from its own fresh scan, so a candidate path is only ever a pick from
 * what the server offered; duplicating any part of that here would create a
 * second answer to "what does this tree contain".
