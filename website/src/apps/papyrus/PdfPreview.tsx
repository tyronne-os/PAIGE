/**
 * PdfPreview — the rendered-PDF pane.
 *
 * Uses the BROWSER's own PDF viewer (in an `<iframe>`; see below) rather than
 * bundling a JS renderer. That is a deliberate dependency decision: the upstream
 * app shipped `pdfjs-dist` plus a hand-written text layer and its stylesheet
 * (~1 MB of JS and a worker chunk) to reproduce something Chrome, Firefox, Safari
 * and Edge all do natively — including text selection, find-in-page, zoom, page
 * thumbnails, rotate and print. This repository has no PDF renderer today, and
 * adding one to reimplement a built-in viewer is not a trade worth making.
 *
 * The backend serves the PDF with `Content-Disposition: inline` and a restrictive
 * per-response CSP (`sandbox; default-src 'none'`), so the document — which is
 * content the agent or a cloned repository produced — cannot script the
 * dashboard's origin. That per-response header is the containment; it does not
 * depend on which element embeds the document.
 *
 * `<iframe>`, NOT `<object>`: the dashboard's own base CSP sets `object-src
 * 'none'`, so Chromium and Firefox refused to load the plugin document and the
 * pane rendered the "cannot display a PDF inline" fallback on the app's headline
 * feature. (It went unnoticed because WebKit does not enforce the directive for
 * this case, so it worked in Safari.) `frame-src 'self'` already permits a
 * same-origin frame, so this needs no CSP widening — the previous justification
 * for `<object>` cited an `onError` handler that was never actually wired up, so
 * nothing is lost: a browser with no PDF viewer still gets the download link
 * below the frame rather than as replaced content.
 *
 * A keyed remount on `src` is what makes a recompile visible: the same-URL
 * document would otherwise be served from the in-page cache, which is why the URL
 * carries a version counter.
