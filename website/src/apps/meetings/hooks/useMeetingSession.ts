 * Whether the microphone may open for an `active` meeting.

 * SUSPENDED for direct fan-out. The fast start poll exists to observe `active`
 * early, so without a readiness gate it opened the microphone tens of seconds
 * before ingress: early finals burned through the short dispatch retry schedule
 * (~4.6s) against a ~46s initialization and were PERMANENTLY lost from the notes
 * and tasks.
 *
 * That gate cost the opening of every meeting instead — the mic simply stayed
 * shut for those ~46s and the speech was never captured at all (issue #4610).
 * The server now HOLDS speech through initialization, so there are two states in
 * which a line lands: fanned out immediately (`accepting_dispatches`) or held and
 * replayed in order when the agents are ready (`buffering_dispatches`). Capture
 * must open for BOTH, and a server that reports neither is still the closed case
 * this gate was written for — stopping, reviewing, expired, or no live session.
 *
 * `ingressReady` is that pair of server flags, reported on every meta poll — the
 * same holder state the dispatch endpoint itself checks. Gating on the POLLED
 * value rather than on the start
 * mutation's lifecycle makes every client-side inference hole unreachable at
 * once, because the mutation's outcome is not evidence about ingress in either
 * direction: an error settlement can hide a server-side success (the ~46s
 * request is exactly the shape a proxy timeout kills), and a success response
 * can be lost in transit. With the polled flag, the mic simply follows what
 * the server reports: closed while initialization holds ingress shut, open on
 * the first poll after `resume_dispatches` — whatever became of the start
 * request itself. A reload or a second tab lands on the same rule, which also
 * closes the pre-existing hole where a tab that never started the meeting
 * opened its mic mid-initialization.
 *
 * The Live badge and controls still key off `status` and appear within ~1s of
 * Start; only capture waits for the server to report ingress open.

   * puts them all back under the gate for the cost of nine `i18nT(...)` wrappers.
