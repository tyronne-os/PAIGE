/**
 * Commands contributed by installed apps.
 *
 * This is what lets a Command Bar row live OUTSIDE this repository. An app
 * declares `contributes.commands` in its manifest; this module turns that
 * declaration into rows the launcher can rank and run. Nothing here executes app
 * code — a contribution is data, and the host is the only thing that acts on it.
 *
 * **Everything below re-validates what the backend already checks.** That is not
 * belt-and-braces for its own sake: `AppManifest` only grew a typed `contributes`
 * field recently, and an unknown top-level manifest key reaches this dashboard
 * through the manifest's `extra` bucket without passing any schema at all. So an
 * app installed by an older gateway, or one whose `app.json` was edited in place,
 * can put an arbitrary object on this path. Manifest data from a third party is
 * untrusted input; the same posture the overlay resolver takes.
 *
 * A bad declaration is SKIPPED with a warning, never thrown: a malformed app must
 * not be able to take the launcher down (and by extension the Cmd+K gesture) for
 * every other app on the instance.
 *
 * Kept pure and dependency-light so the rules are pinned by unit test rather than
 * by reading the component. Icons stay STRINGS here; resolving one to a glyph is
 * the renderer's job.

  // to empty then erased the provenance: `kindLabel` renders a bare kind when there is
  // no label, which is character-for-character what a BUILTIN row shows, so a
  // contributed row whose prompt goes to a tool-enabled agent read as native.
  //
  // So the label degrades in steps and never becomes empty -- the app's `name`, else
  // that name clipped. `name` needs the bound as much as a `displayName` would:
  // `KEBAB_RE` constrains its alphabet and not its length, and this

  // The clip carries no ellipsis, and deliberately: it would be the one rendered string
  // literal in this file, and it is not copy that any of the eleven catalogs could
  // translate. It also would not earn its keep -- two over-long names sharing a
  // 120-character prefix render identically with or without a marker, so the ellipsis
  // does not disambiguate the provenance it would appear to qualify. What survives the
  // clip is what the label is for: a prefix of the contributing app's own identifier,
  // which is still unmistakably not a builtin.
  // The attribution, and it comes from `name` -- NEVER `displayName`.
  //
  // `displayName` is free text the app chooses. As provenance that makes it unusable in
  // two directions, and the paragraphs above understate both:
  //
  //   * It can claim to be the host. A manifest saying `displayName: "Kiro Crew"` puts
  //     that string where this row states its owner, so the row reads as native and the
  //     reader runs its prompt believing core sent it.
  //   * `||` is not the emptiness test it looks like. `validate()` refuses only a FALSY
  //     `displayName` (`if not self.displayName`), so `"   "` -- or a zero-width
  //     `\u200b` that survives `.trim()` -- is "present", wins over the name, and renders
  //     the empty label the second paragraph above describes as reading like a builtin.
  //
  // `name` is the install identity: `KEBAB_RE` constrains it to `[a-z0-9]` plus single
  // hyphens, so it can neither be blank nor spell a host word with a space or a capital,
  // and it is unique across installed apps in a way `displayName` is not. The clip below
