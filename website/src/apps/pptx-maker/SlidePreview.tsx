/**
 * SlidePreview — renders one composed slide as SVG, animating what just changed.
 *
 * The engine's compose step emits a payload of per-component SVG fragments plus
 * each component's bounding box and a `changed` flag. This component assembles
 * them into a single `<svg>` and, when the payload's epoch moves (a recompose),
 * fades in only the changed components so the user can see WHICH parts of the
 * slide the agent just rewrote.
 *
 * Why the SVG is built imperatively rather than as JSX: the fragments are opaque
 * SVG source strings produced by the engine, so they have to be parsed into real
 * nodes.
 *
 * **Every fragment is sanitized through DOMPurify in SVG mode before it is
 * parsed, then walked a second time to strip off-origin URL references**
 * (`setSvgFragment` below). The payload is written by a model driving the engine,
 * and an SVG document can carry `<script>`, `on*` handlers and `<foreignObject>`
 * — so this content is treated exactly like any other untrusted markup the
 * dashboard renders, not trusted because it came from our own backend. The
 * second pass exists because DOMPurify is an XSS filter and not an egress
 * filter: it keeps `<image href>`, and this subtree renders on the dashboard's
 * OWN origin, so a passive cross-origin GET would exfiltrate the deck. The
 * subtree is additionally `pointer-events: none`.
 *
 * Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`: the reduced path renders the final
 * state immediately with no staged reveal.

 *    HTML-namespaced elements that never paint. Taking the DOM back from
 *    DOMPurify preserves the SVG namespace.

 *

 * dashboard's own origin — not inside a null-origin sandboxed frame the way the
 * style boards in `BoardFrame` are. The dashboard CSP allows `img-src … https:`,
