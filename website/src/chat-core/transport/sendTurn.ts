 *  same from here. Delivery is INDETERMINATE -- not a failure signal and not a

/**
 * Every outcome a send can have, normalized. This is the receipt contract that
 * used to be re-derived (differently) at each hand-rolled call site. Parsing
 * (`refused` vs `unknown` vs accepted) is `readSendReceipt`'s ruling; this
 * layer adds the outcomes a parse cannot see -- the abort deadline and the
 * transport reject -- and splits acceptance by what it means for
 * an optimistic bubble:
 *
 * - `dispatched`      -- the server took custody of the message as an IMMEDIATE
 *                        turn. This is the delivery receipt for an optimistic
 *                        bubble: no `chat_message` echo is coming for a
 *                        dashboard send, the HTTP response is all there is.
 * - `queued`          -- the slot was busy and the server queued the message.
 *                        The `queue_push` broadcast owns its on-screen card, so
 *                        this is NOT a receipt for an optimistic bubble, and a
 *                        queued message is still cancellable.
 * - `refused`         -- the server said no: a non-2xx status, or a readable
 *                        body with neither `ok` nor `queued`. Nothing was sent,
 *                        so the payload is safe to hand back. `reason` is the
 *                        server's own explanation when there is one.
 * - `unknown`         -- a 2xx whose body could not be read. The request WAS
 *                        accepted and only the answer is mangled, so the send
 *                        may well have started a turn; reporting it as a
 *                        failure would hand the payload back and invite a
 *                        retry that duplicates a delivered turn. Callers must
 *                        do NOTHING on this status.
 * - `response-late`   -- the abort deadline fired before a receipt arrived.
 *                        Delivery is indeterminate: a composer can keep its
 *                        optimistic row pending to avoid a duplicate, while a
 *                        caller that has already destroyed the only visible
 *                        copy may choose to recover it.
 * - `transport-error` -- the fetch itself rejected without a response. Usually
 *                        the request never left (offline, DNS, CORS), but a
 *                        connection reset AFTER the server took the POST rejects
 *                        the same way, so delivery is INDETERMINATE -- the
 *                        request may have started a turn. What to do is
 *                        call-site policy: a composer restores the text and
 *                        reports (a visible duplicate beats a silent loss); a
 *                        caller whose retry would destroy or duplicate work
 *                        (a seeder deleting its slot) must not treat this as
 *                        proof that nothing ran.
