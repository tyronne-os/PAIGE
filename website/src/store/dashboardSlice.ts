/** Apply an authoritative slot list, reusing the object identity of every row
 *  whose content is unchanged, and touching `state.slots` only when the list

 *
 *  Membership AND order come from `next` — the server is authoritative on both.
 *  Only per-row identity is carried across, and only for a structurally equal
 *  row, so no consumer can read stale content off a reused reference. The
 *  comparison uses the shared `jsonEqual`, whose key-order independence and
 *  field-agnosticism this relies on: a row may have been patched in place by
 *  `touchSlotActivity` / `updateSlot` / `patchSlotLink` since it was stored (so
 *  its key order can differ from the payload's), and a comparator that listed
 *  `ChatSlot`'s fields would stop seeing a newly added one and pin a stale row
 *  on screen — a correctness bug, where an extra re-render is only a cost.
 *
 *  Identity is load-bearing here rather than a micro-optimisation. The sidebar
 *  renders every row as a Framer `motion.div` with `layout="position"` inside one
 *  `LayoutGroup`, and every selector over `dashboard.slots` invalidates when the
 *  array or any row changes reference. Assigning the incoming array wholesale
 *  hands every row a new reference on every frame, so one slot's status change
 *  re-renders and re-measures the entire list — which reads as the sidebar
 *  reloading rather than as one session becoming active. Slot pushes coalesce at
 *  200ms server-side, so a single active turn delivers several full lists per
 *  second and the effect is continuous.
 *
 *  Skipping the assignment (rather than assigning an equal array) is the half
 *  that matters most: it leaves the array reference alone, which lets a
 *  downstream `useMemo` skip its filter and sort entirely instead of recomputing
 *  an equal result. */
