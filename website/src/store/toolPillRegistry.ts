/**
 * Module-level registry that tracks which inline tool pills are currently
 * visible in the viewport. Pending-approval pills register their DOM node
 * here; the approval bar in ChatInput subscribes via {@link useToolPillVisible}
 * so it can grow a "ghost pill" when the inline pill scrolls out of sight.
 *
 * Why a module-level store and not Redux? This is purely ephemeral viewport
 * state with no need for time-travel/devtools, and updates fire on every
 * scroll frame — far too noisy for the Redux dev experience.
 *
 * Default visibility when no entry is registered is `false` ("we cannot see
 * the pill, so show the ghost"). This is the correct fallback for the most
 * common no-entry case: Virtuoso has virtualised the pill out of the DOM
 * because the user scrolled far away, so the inline view is unreachable
 * and the ghost must take over.
 *
 * The brief no-entry window during the very first mount of a pending pill
 * is bridged by `useSyncExternalStore`: the layout-effect registration in
 * `ToolCallLine` notifies the store synchronously within the same commit,
 * so the snapshot flips to the real visibility value before the browser
 * paints — no flicker.
