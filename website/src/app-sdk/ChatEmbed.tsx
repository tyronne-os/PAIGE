   *  here too — an agent's follow-up choices should never be silently dropped just
   *  because the surface embedding them is thinner.
   *
   *  `followUpIsPlan` is DELIBERATELY dropped here (#6057): this embed is not a
   *  plan-capable host, so a plan-shaped chip stays on the composer-draft path
   *  instead of dispatching POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/plan-action. Why that is
   *  a recorded exclusion rather than a live mis-dispatch:
   *  - The slot-detail payload this embed polls carries no `mode` field, so the
   *    embed structurally lacks the orchestrator-mode gate the dispatch path
   *    requires (ChatPane/ChatPage read the slot record's mode before
   *    dispatching; there is no equivalent source here).
   *  - Exposure is narrow: `api_chat_slot_detail` runs
   *    `_deny_cross_app_slot_access`, so an app-token embed 404s on any foreign
   *    or unscoped slot. That proves "not another surface's slot", not "never a
   *    plan-bearing slot" — an app could create and embed its own
   *    orchestrator-mode slot, which is exactly why the missing mode field
   *    above, not the ownership guard, carries the exclusion.
   *  - On hosts that DO dispatch, the `isPlanAction` allowlist keeps
   *    non-protocol plan-shaped labels on the composer path; this file never
   *    consults it because it never dispatches.
   *  SideChat makes the same exclusion, silently — it also destructures only
   *  `followUpOptions`, with no record there. If dashboard-token embeds ever
   *  need working plan chips, the parity option is wiring `usePlanActionMutation`
   *  plus a mode source into this file — a product decision, not an oversight.
