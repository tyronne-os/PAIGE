  // by a harness that wires a fake ACP backend) re-includes the @needs-agent
  // specs. @needs-live-agent currently tags nothing: the last holder was the
  // budget-expiry soft-stop, which the fake does model ([[SLOW_NOACK]] withholds
  // the cancel ack), so it moved to @needs-agent. The tag stays wired as the
  // seam for a spec that genuinely needs real model semantics.
