/**
 * Capture harness for Developer > Agent Backend, once it reads the machine probe.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind a static file server with every
 * /api/** call answered from fixtures — no gateway, no token, no agent. The panel
 * is static, so these are still PNGs rather than video.
 *
 * ## Why the scenes are fixtures rather than this machine's real state
 *
 * The panel composes TWO independent server facts, and one of the three verdicts
 * each fact can carry is unreachable on any single host: a public build never
 * reports `claude` as selectable, and `installed: "unknown"` only happens when the
 * probe itself raises. Shooting only the local truth would leave the two lines this
 * change exists for undocumented. Every scene below is therefore a payload the
 * server can genuinely emit; the FIRST one is this machine's real answer, recorded
 * from an unmocked probe call, and the others vary one field from it.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-agent-backend-probe.mjs [outDir]
