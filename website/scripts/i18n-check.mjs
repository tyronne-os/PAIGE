/**
 * The i18n gate chain — run ALL of it, then report once.
 *
 * ## Why a runner and not `a && b && c`
 *
 * `package.json` used to chain six scripts with `&&`, which short-circuits: the first
 * failure hides the other ten checks, so an author fixes one, pushes, waits ~5
 * minutes for `frontend-lint`, and discovers the next. Eleven checks means up to eleven
 * rounds for one PR. They are independent measurements over the same tree; there is
 * no reason to learn them one at a time.
 *
 * ## What the output is organised around
 *
 * One question: **is this mine to fix?** A `diff`-scoped finding is on a line this
 * branch wrote or in a file it touched — there is no number to raise and no one else
 * to wait for. A `repo`-scoped finding is a whole-repo measurement the branch may
 * simply have inherited. That distinction was previously unstated, and it is exactly
 * what cost other people's PRs in both the `PrivacyPanel` and `projects.latent`
 * incidents: eleven PRs went red on a gate none of their diffs had tripped, and the
 * log gave no way to tell.
 *
 * The `enforce` column is the other half of it, because a reader cannot otherwise
 * know that one of these checks fails when a number goes DOWN.
 *
 * ## Where the verdict lives
 *
 * Not here. `lib/i18n-gate-table.mjs` decides it as a pure function over plain data,
 * because the first version of this file got the exit code wrong in a way nothing
 * could test: a script that crashed before printing anything recognisable had all its
 * rows classified as unknowns, and the run exited 0 where the `&&` chain exited 2.
 * The invariant now under unit test is that a non-zero child always fails.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 all clear · 1 at least one check failed · 2 a script could not be run.
