/**
 * Render-time i18n scanner — the DOM half of the Phase 5 gate.
 *
 * Every other i18n gate in this repo reads SOURCE (an eslint pass over `src`) or
 * CATALOG JSON. Both are blind to the same two things: a string that is never
 * extracted at all reads as ordinary TypeScript, and a sentence assembled from
 * three catalog keys reads as three correct lookups. Only the rendered page shows
 * either one. This file is that check.
 *
 * It runs against the `en-XA` pseudolocale, where `gen-pseudolocale.mjs` has
 * already given us two properties we can assert on cheaply:
 *
 *   1. every catalog value is wrapped in `[` … `]`, so a `]…[` seam inside one
 *      inline run is a surviving concatenation; and
 *   2. every ASCII letter outside a preserved region is accented, so any plain
 *      Latin letter outside a `[` … `]` unit is text that never reached a catalog.
 *
 * DUAL TARGET. The same source runs in two places, and there is deliberately only
 * one copy of the logic:
 *   - Node, via `import` — `renderScan.test.ts` exercises the pure text functions.
 *   - the browser, via `browserBundle()` — `check-i18n-render.mjs` strips the
 *     `export` keywords and injects the result with `page.addScriptTag`.
 * Because of the second target this file must stay import-free and top-level-side-
 * effect-free, and every export must be a plain `export function` / `export const`
 * that `STRIP_EXPORT` can rewrite. Nothing here may reference module scope that
 * would not survive being pasted into a page.
