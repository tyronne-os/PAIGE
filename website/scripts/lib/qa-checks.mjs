/**
 * Catalog QA check definitions — the single definition, shared by both consumers.
 *
 * Two gates need exactly these predicates and must never disagree about them:
 *
 *   - `src/i18n/qa.test.ts` counts violations across the whole catalog set and holds
 *     the frozen debt as a per-check ceiling.
 *   - `scripts/check-source-strings.mjs` runs them at ZERO tolerance over the values
 *     this branch added or changed, which is what keeps the ceiling from being a way
 *     to swap one malformed string for another.
 *
 * They used to live inside the test file, on the stated reasoning that a check and its
 * assertions cannot drift apart if there is only one copy. That reasoning is why this
 * is a module rather than a second copy: the diff-scoped gate is a script, so the
 * shared definition has to be importable from plain Node. Both consumers import from
 * here and neither redefines anything.
