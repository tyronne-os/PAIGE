/**
 * Screenshot harness for the in-transcript recovery card.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) against a static file server with every
 * /api/** call and the /api/ws websocket answered from fixtures. No gateway, no
 * token, no agent. The client code is unmodified — only the network is stubbed —
 * so the transcript, its virtualizer and the card render exactly as in
 * production.
 *
 * The fixture transcript carries one row of each recovery kind (tool refusal,
 * stalled turn, stalled tool) using the verbatim prefixes the gateway prepends,
 * so the shots prove the prefix detection as well as the layout.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-recovery-card.mjs [outDir]
