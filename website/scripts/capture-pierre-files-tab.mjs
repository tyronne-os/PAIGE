/**
 * Screenshot harness for the FILES-TAB surfaces of the Monaco → Pierre
 * migration: the pinned Files tab's tree rail, and the file viewer's
 * preview / source / diff modes with that rail docked beside them.
 *
 * Same house pattern as `capture-pierre-chat-diffs.mjs`: the REAL built SPA
 * (`website/dist`) behind the shared in-process static server, with every
 * `/api/**` answered from fixtures via Playwright route interception —
 * gateway-free (no kiro-cli, no live backend, no token). The client code under
 * test is unmodified.
 *
 * NEW FIXTURES (no sibling script stubbed these before):
 *   /api/project/tree         → the workspace path set the Pierre tree renders
 *   /api/project/git/status   → the changed-file set (Changed mode + lanes)
 *   /api/project/git          → repo/branch probe
 *   /api/file-read            → cold-tab content hydration (ChatPage useQueries)
 *   /api/file-diff            → the working-tree baseline the diff mode renders
 *
 * The panel state is pre-seeded through localStorage rather than driven by
 * clicks, because both surfaces are PERSISTED stores rather than props:
 *   `mc-activity-open:<slot>`  chatSlice's per-slot panel open flag
 *   `mc-panel-tabs:<slot>`     usePanelTabs' bucket ({activeId, tabs})
 * A file tab persists WITHOUT its content by design (`serializeBucket` strips
 * heavy bodies), so ChatPage's cold-tab hydration re-reads it from
 * `/api/file-read` — which is why that fixture is load-bearing, not decorative.
 *
 * Frames:
 *   10-files-tab-all-files    the pinned Files tab, ALL FILES: the tree rail
 *                             beside the (fileless) viewer column
 *   11-files-tab-changed      the same tab with the CHANGED filter selected —
 *                             the git-status set only, fully expanded, count
 *                             badge on the segment
 *   12-file-preview-aligned   THE PAIR (with 13): one markdown file in PREVIEW
 *   13-file-source-aligned    …and in SOURCE. Both are a clip of the panel's
 *                             TOP BAND, so the top of the prose/code AND the
 *                             top of the rail are in frame and directly
 *                             comparable. They prove the fix where preview sat
 *                             ~16px lower than source: a `py-4` inset lived on
 *                             the flex row that ALSO holds the tree rail, so
 *                             the preview inset pushed the RAIL down too. The
 *                             inset is horizontal-only now (`pl-4 pr-0`).
 *   14-file-diff-mode         the viewer in DIFF mode (buffer vs HEAD), split
 *   15-unsaved-banner         the unsaved-changes banner: inside the preview
 *                             column only, header height unchanged, rail not
 *                             shifted
 *   16-overflow-menu          the ⋯ menu open: the view-options group (word
 *                             wrap / line numbers / collapse unchanged) ruled
 *                             off from Refresh / Full screen above it
 *
 * Frames 10, 11, 14, 15, 16 are ELEMENT screenshots of the side panel; 12 and
 * 13 are top-band clips of the same element. Dimensions are asserted after
 * every write against the 2000px-per-edge PR-media budget.

Every code and diff surface in the dashboard now renders through

## Surfaces

| File viewer diff | MonacoDiffViewer | \`PierreFilePair\` |

| Workspace tree | hand-rolled list | \`@pierre/trees\` |

## The file-tab layout

The viewer column and the browser rail are siblings in ONE flex row, under a
single full-width header. That is what makes the inset rule below load-bearing:

- the row's inset is **horizontal only** (\`pl-4 pr-0\`)
- vertical breathing room belongs INSIDE the scroll box
- a \`py-4\` on the row would push the rail down with the prose

const options = {
  diffStyle: sideBySide ? 'split' : 'unified',
  overflow: wordWrap ? 'wrap' : 'scroll',
  expandUnchanged: !collapseUnchanged,
}
\`\`\`

## Open questions

1. Should the rail width persist per project rather than app-wide?
2. Does the collapsed-region separator need a keyboard affordance?

   * The rail's tree is asserted by reading its SHADOW ROOT's text, not with

   *
   *  - `@pierre/trees`' `FileTree` ignores the `className` it is handed (same as
   *    `PierreCode` / `PierrePatch`), so there is no `.pierre-tree` node to
   *    address.
   *  - every row renders inside a `<file-tree-container>` shadow root, so the
   *    panel's own `innerText` / `textContent` never sees a single filename.
   *  - a row name is SPLIT across nodes around a middle-truncation marker:
   *    `AGENTS.md` renders as `AGENTS.` + `…` + `md`, and `website` as
   *    `webs` + `…` + `ite`. So NO element contains a whole filename, and
   *    `getByText('AGENTS.md')` / `text=website` both match zero nodes even
   *    though the name is plainly on screen. That is why the earlier
   *    locator-based probes failed on a tree that had rendered perfectly.
   *
   * The root is open, so `host.shadowRoot.textContent` is readable. Dropping the
   * `…` markers rejoins the halves, which makes a plain `includes(name)` a true
   * statement about what the tree actually painted.
