/**
 * Screenshot harness for moving the "Chat on a crew" preview opt-in from
 * Settings > Remote Instances to Developer > Feature Previews.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared in-process static
 * server and answers every /api/** call from fixtures via Playwright route
 * interception — gateway-free, no kiro-cli, no dashboard auth.
 *
 * Two shots, because a MOVE is only legible as a pair: the destination has to
 * show the card arriving, and the origin has to show it gone. A single frame of
 * either one proves half the change and reads as an addition.
 *
 * Labels come from the CATALOG, not from literals, so a key rename breaks the
 * capture loudly instead of silently shooting the wrong page. The origin shot
 * asserts ABSENCE against the same catalog string the destination shot found, so
 * the pair cannot both pass on a build where the copy moved but the toggle did
 * not.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-chat-on-crew-toggle-move.mjs [outDir] [prefix]
 *   Run against the branch (after) and against a main build (before).
