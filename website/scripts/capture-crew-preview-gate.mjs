/**
 * Screenshot harness for "crew is hidden until the operator opts in".
 *
 * The change is a VISIBILITY change, so the evidence has to be a pair: the same
 * two surfaces with the flag off and with it on. A single frame proves nothing
 * here — an absent rail row is indistinguishable from a harness that failed to
 * boot, which is why every shot below is taken next to an assertion that names
 * what must be present in that state.
 *
 *   01/04  the sidebar: the `Crew` rail row and the create menu's
 *          "New Crew Mode chat" entry, both absent at 01 and present at 04.
 *   02/03  Developer > Feature Previews: the crew card, off then on. The `on`
 *          frame is taken on the SAME page as the `off` one, so the rail row
 *          appearing behind the card is the evidence that the flip lands live
 *          with no reload — and the rail row is the whole ingress, since this
 *          card deliberately carries no link of its own (the webhooks card
 *          needs one only because `/webhooks` is `hiddenFromNav`).
 *
 * The rail row is located by its registry `navId` (`[data-onboarding-nav]`)
 * rather than by its label: the label is translated, so an English-only locator
 * would report a false "hidden" in every other locale and this harness would
 * then certify the gate from the one case that cannot fail.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared loopback static
 * server with every /api/** call answered from fixtures — gateway-free, no
 * kiro-cli, no dashboard token.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-crew-preview-gate.mjs [outDir]
