/**
 * Screenshots of the declined re-investigate notice (issue #6270).
 *
 * Drives the ISOLATED capture entry (website/capture/declined-reinvestigate-notice.html),
 * which mounts the REAL IssueDetail with `fetch` stubbed at the network seam. The
 * decline is produced by CLICKING Resume, so `openSession` runs its own probe,
 * record re-read and concluded branch — the frame is the shipped code path, not a
 * prop set by hand.
 *
 * Every scene asserts its headline state before shooting, so this can never
 * quietly emit a screenshot of a resting header or an error boundary.
 *
 * The narrow scene is the one the two earlier in-row attempts failed: 320px is the
 * floor `website/docs/narrow-viewport.md` requires, and it is where a wrapping sibling
 * in the header's `flex-shrink-0` action group pushed the row apart. The notice is
 * portalled out of that row, so this frame is the evidence that it no longer can.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6812 --strictPort   # in another shell
 *   node scripts/capture-declined-reinvestigate.mjs http://127.0.0.1:6812 ../temp-screenshots/declined-reinvestigate-6270
