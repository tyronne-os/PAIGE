/**
 * Diff-scoped catalog quality gate. Two passes, both zero-tolerance, neither backed by
 * a stored ledger — so neither can ever conflict between branches.
 *
 * **Pass 1 — new English source strings.** The quality of *new English copy*, before it
 * is ever translated. That is the cheapest possible fix point. A fragment like
 * `'Findings ('` costs one edit if it is caught when it is written, and ten translations
 * plus a re-review if it is caught after the catalogs are generated. Mozilla — the
 * closest analogue, with catalogs in git and no TMS — runs a whole quarantine branch for
 * this; a diff-scoped check gets the mechanical half of it for free.
 *
 * **Pass 2 — every catalog value this branch added or changed, in every language.** This
 * is the guard `qa-allowlist.json` used to provide. `src/i18n/qa.test.ts` holds the
 * frozen debt as a per-check COUNT ceiling rather than a frozen set of 948 sites,
 * because regenerating that set on every fix made it conflict between all parallel
 * branches. A count cannot distinguish "one fixed" from "one fixed and one broken", so
 * the ceiling alone would let a cleanup pay for a regression. Restricting the strict
 * check to changed values closes that at zero storage cost. The check predicates are
 * shared with `qa.test.ts` via `lib/qa-checks.mjs`, so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * ## Scoping
 *
 * Pass 1 checks only keys absent from `en.json` at the merge base, so the frozen
 * pre-existing violations are irrelevant here and there is nothing to allowlist. Pass 2
 * checks only values that differ from the merge base, and exempts a translation whose
 * English source trips the same check — an unbalanced source cannot have a balanced
 * translation. Base ref comes from `I18N_BASE_REF`, else `origin/main`.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT carved out
 *
 * A PR that only wraps existing hardcoded English is exempt from the *coverage*
 * ratchet — that work is the point of the next phase and must not be penalised. It is
 * NOT exempt here, because these checks are about the SHAPE of the string, and a
 * fragment is a fragment whether it was newly authored or newly lifted out of JSX. If
 * `'Findings ('` is being wrapped, the correct change is to wrap the whole sentence.
 *
 * An earlier version exempted any value that already existed in the catalog under
 * another key, on the theory that this identified a wrap. It does not — a wrapped
 * string is new to the catalog by definition — and it handed a permanent pass to every
 * bad shape that already appeared once. `'Findings ('` and `'s'` both slipped through.
 *
 * Truncation is not checked. Keys are slugs of their value capped at 48 characters, so
 * a long string legitimately produces a key that reads like a fragment.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-source-strings.mjs
 *   I18N_BASE_REF=origin/main node scripts/check-source-strings.mjs
