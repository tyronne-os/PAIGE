/**
 * Screenshot + measurement harness for the session row's STATUS MARKER position.
 *
 * The defect this proves is a COLLISION, so the evidence has to be two x's read
 * from a real browser: where the row's status glyph starts, and how far in the
 * recency tint's opaque accent stripe reaches.
 *
 * The marker used to live in an absolutely-positioned gutter inside the row's
 * `pl-3.5`, at x 1..13. The recency tint (Display settings → "Highlight recent
 * sessions", `utils/recencyTint.ts`) paints an opaque accent stripe up to 7px wide
 * at that same left edge, and the session-colour bar takes the first 2px. Accent
 * ink on an accent stripe is a 1:1 contrast, so on a recent session — which is
 * exactly the session that is running — the spinner lost its left half and read as
 * clipped and mis-placed. Inline at the head of the secondary line, the marker
 * starts at the content column instead and clears both by construction.
 *
 * Deliberately SHAPE-AGNOSTIC: it finds the marker by its own class
 * (`svg.animate-spin`, the unread dot's `.rounded-full`) rather than by walking a
 * fixed child index, so the SAME script runs against the before and after trees.
 * That is what makes the pair comparable — a before/after captured by two
 * different scripts proves nothing about the change.
 *
 * The tint is OFF by default (`RECENT_TINT_COUNT = 0`), so the fixture turns it on
 * through the same server config the dashboard reads, and every slot carries a
 * settled `last_turn_ts` so the ranking has something to rank.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared loopback static server
 * with every /api/** call answered from fixtures (gateway-free).
 *
 * Set MARKER_BASELINE=1 when running against the PRE-FIX tree: the overlap check
 * becomes a report (the baseline fails it, which is the point) and the shots are
 * written as `00-BEFORE-*`.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-session-status-marker.mjs [outDir]
