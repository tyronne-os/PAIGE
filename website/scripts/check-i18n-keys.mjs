/**
 * Catalog-key reference gate — does every key the source asks for actually EXIST?
 *
 * ## The defect this gates (observed, not hypothetical)
 *
 * i18next returns a missing key as its own fallback rather than throwing, so a
 * reference to a key that is not in the catalog renders the dotted path itself into
 * the UI — `pages.chat.activityViewer.show_all` where a button label should be. Every
 * other i18n gate in this repo asks a different question and is blind to it:
 *
 *   catalogParity      compares the 9 target catalogs AGAINST en. A key absent from
 *                      en is absent from all of them, so parity is perfect.
 *   deadKeys           the other direction — catalog keys nothing references.
 *   dynamicKeys        forbids ASSEMBLING a key; says nothing about whether a
 *                      perfectly literal key exists.
 *   check-i18n-strings the string is translated; it never asks if the key resolves.
 *   gen-pseudolocale   derived from en, so it inherits en's gaps silently.
 *
 * Phase 3 item 1a proved the hole live: it collapsed a shared count-badge fragment
 * into `show_all_count` and updated one of the key's TWO render sites. The catalogs
 * were internally consistent, `catalogParity`, `deadKeys` and `qa.test.ts` all passed,
 * and the only thing that noticed was an unrelated component test that happened to
 * assert the rendered text. Phase 3 renames and deletes catalog keys at scale, so that
 * near-miss is the normal case, not the exception.
 *
 * ## Why the TypeScript compiler API and not a regex
 *
 * The same reason `i18n-plural-codemod.mjs` was rewritten as an AST check: a regex
 * over `i18nT\('([^']+)'\)` hard-codes the quote style, the function name, the absence
 * of a line break inside the call, and — fatally here — it cannot tell a key in CALL
 * position from the same dotted string in a doc comment, a test fixture or an
 * `expect()` assertion. Resolution has to follow `const` bindings and `as const` maps
 * to be worth anything (see the four resolvable shapes below), and that is a scope
 * question, not a text question.
 *
 * ## What "resolvable" means — four shapes beyond the plain literal
 *
 * A call site is STATIC if a finite set of possible key strings can be computed from
 * syntax alone. That is deliberately more than `i18nT('a.b.c')`, because the repo's
 * own recommended fix for a dynamic key (`dynamicKeys.test.ts`) is an `as const` map,
 * and a gate that could not see through the recommended fix would punish it:
 *
 *   literal          i18nT('pages.x.y')
 *   const binding    const K = 'pages.x.y'          → i18nT(K)
 *   map access       UPDATE_ERROR_KEYS.offline      → i18nT(UPDATE_ERROR_KEYS.offline)
 *                    STATUS_LABEL_KEY[st]           → union of ALL the map's values
 *   finite choice    cond ? 'pages.x.a' : 'pages.x.b'   (and `??` / `||`)
 *
 * Every member of the resolved set must exist. `STATUS_LABEL_KEY[st]` therefore
 * validates three keys from one call site, which is exactly the coverage a manifest
 * would have had to declare by hand.
 *
 * ## Why not i18next's typed keys, which would make tsc do this
 *
 * The industry-standard alternative is `CustomTypeOptions` with a generated key union,
 * turning `i18nT` into `i18nT(key: <union of every key>)` so a dangling reference is a
 * compile error with the type checker's own scope resolution instead of this file's
 * approximation of one. It is the better end state and is already on the plan as Phase 6
 * item 6. It is not the right thing to land here, for three reasons:
 *
 *  1. **It cannot report a coverage number.** A computed key widens to `string` and the
 *     union check silently stops applying. That is precisely the population this gate
 *     exists to *count* and ratchet — a typed union would make it invisible again.
 *  2. **It cannot land before the keys are stable.** Phase 3 renames and deletes keys at
 *     scale; a generated union regenerated mid-phase turns every in-flight branch into a
 *     merge conflict on one enormous type. The gate that protects those renames has to
 *     precede them, and this one needs no codegen artifact.
 *  3. **`strictKeyChecks` needs one catalog.** Keys live in `en.json` (codemod-generated)
 *     and `en.manual.json` (hand-written) and the union would have to be their merge —
 *     which is also why this script asserts the two never shadow each other. Settling
 *     that shape is Phase 6 work.
 *
 * So: this is a stopgap with a defined end, not permanent infrastructure. When Phase 6
 * item 6 lands the typed union, the resolver here should be deleted and only the
 * dynamic-site ratchet kept.
 *
 * ## Dynamic keys are counted, not waved through
 *
 * A key genuinely computed at runtime cannot be resolved by any tool — `i18next-cli`'s
 * own docs concede this and fall back to `preservePatterns` globs. The honest response
 * is not an allowlist file (which rots, and which `dynamicKeys.test.ts` already made
 * unnecessary by banning assembly outright) but a COUNT: `dynamic-keys-baseline.json`
 * records the unresolvable call sites per file, bidirectionally. That number IS the
 * gate's coverage statement — an unstated dynamic population is a silent blind spot —
 * and the downward pressure is what turns `i18nT(s.labelKey)` into a map access
 * eventually instead of leaving it there forever. This gets the stale-exemption
 * detection `ember-intl-analyzer` exposes as a dedicated option out of the ratchet
 * itself, rather than from a second file.
 *
 * ## Dispositions, and why they differ
 *
 *   dangling references  HARD ZERO. Not a ratchet: each one is a live bug rendering a
 *                        raw key to a user. "Acceptable debt" is not a coherent
 *                        position for broken output, and unlike an untranslated string
 *                        there is no burn-down to schedule — the fix is one edit.
 *   dynamic call sites   PER-FILE BIDIRECTIONAL RATCHET, the `check-i18n-strings.mjs`
 *                        idiom, for the reasons given there: per file so one file's
 *                        fix cannot pay for another's regression, bidirectional so a
 *                        gain cannot be given back.
 *   catalog shadowing    HARD ZERO. `index.ts` deep-merges `en.json` under
 *                        `en.manual.json`, so a key in both silently takes the manual
 *                        value while the codemod keeps regenerating the other one.
 *                        Nothing else checks this: `catalogParity` compares the MERGED
 *                        en against the targets, so it sees one key and is satisfied.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It does not gate the reverse direction. `deadKeys.test.ts` owns "catalog key nothing
 * references" with a baseline of 19, and its reference scan is a quoted-string search
 * over all of `src` — which is STRICTLY WIDER than this file's AST view: it sees
 * `labelKey: 'nav.sessions'` in a data table, a key named in a doc comment, and a key
 * used only by a test. Gating on the narrower AST view would report keys as dead that
 * `deadKeys` correctly calls live, i.e. two gates in the same repo contradicting each
 * other on the same question. `--report` prints the AST-only view as a DIAGNOSTIC so
 * the difference is visible, and never fails on it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs             # gate
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs --report     # gate + coverage / dead-key diagnostics
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs --update     # rewrite the dynamic-site baseline
