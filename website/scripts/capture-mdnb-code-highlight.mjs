/**
 * Screenshot harness for coloured fenced code blocks in the Notes app.
 *
 * The claim needing evidence is that a labelled fence gets syntax colour
 * WITHOUT costing the app its defining gesture — clicking a block opens the
 * markdown source — and that a bare fence stays exactly as plain as before.
 *
 *   01 rendered - a labelled Python fence (coloured) beside a bare fence
 *                 (plain), both on the shipped default theme
 *   02 editing  - the coloured block clicked open: the raw fenced source
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared loopback static
 * server with every /api/** call answered from fixtures. No gateway, no token.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-mdnb-code-highlight.mjs [outDir]

Redeploy the gateway service. The guard is \`check_health(service)\`, which the
fence below calls — inline and fenced code are the same size, so this line and
the block under it must agree:

\`\`\`python
def redeploy(service: str) -> bool:
    # Restart only if health checks are currently green.
    return check_health(service) and restart(service)
\`\`\`

Raw output from the last run, unlabelled on purpose:
