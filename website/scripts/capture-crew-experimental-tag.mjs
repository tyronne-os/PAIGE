/**
 * Screenshot harness for "Crew Mode is tagged Experimental at the point of choice".
 *
 * What the shots have to prove, and why a unit test cannot:
 *
 *   1. The tag is legible in the create menu BEFORE the mode is chosen. The
 *      vitest spec asserts the tag is inside the crew menu item and not the
 *      autopilot one; it cannot say whether the row reads as a caution or as
 *      decoration next to a 13px label.
 *   2. It survives a long localised label. The menu settles at its
 *      `max-w-[264px]` bound in every locale, but NOT because of the tag: the
 *      two mode descriptions are wrapping sentences that fill the width on their
 *      own, so this row's real budget is the ~208px of item content box inside
 *      it. The title row is `flex-wrap` so a label that outgrows that budget
 *      drops the tag to a second line instead of overflowing, and wrapping is a
 *      layout outcome jsdom does not compute (no box model, so `flex-wrap` never
 *      wraps there) — it can only be measured in a real engine.
 *
 *      As shipped the wrap is insurance and stays unexercised: the longest of
 *      the twelve labels still fits on one line. What this pass therefore proves
 *      is the absence of clipping, not the presence of a wrap.
 *
 *      The third pass uses `es`, whose "Nuevo chat de Crew Mode" is the longest
 *      of the twelve shipped labels. NOT the `en-XA` pseudolocale, which would
 *      be the obvious choice and is silently useless here: it is `devOnly`, so
 *      `isRestorableLanguage` drops it in a production build and a persisted
 *      `mc-lang=en-XA` resolves back to `en` — the pass then renders English,
 *      reports success, and proves nothing.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind the shared loopback static
 * server with every /api/** call answered from fixtures (gateway-free — no
 * kiro-cli, no dashboard token, no provider CLI).
 *
 * The menu trigger is found by PROBING rather than by accessible name: its
 * aria-label is itself translated, so `getByLabelText('More create options')`
 * would pass in English and miss in `en-XA` — the one pass that matters here.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-crew-experimental-tag.mjs [outDir]

 * the app shell (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')`)
 * and renders the error boundary instead of the sidebar, so there is no menu to
 * open. That is a pre-existing zero-session boot bug, unrelated to the tag and
 * out of scope here; every other harness in this folder seeds at least one slot,
 * and this one follows suit rather than capturing around a crash.

 * Wait until the menu's entry animation has actually finished.
 *
 * `DropdownMenuContent` enters with `fade-in-0 zoom-in-95 slide-in-from-top-2`,

 * shot taken there catches a 95%-scaled, part-transparent, still-sliding menu.
 * It also corrupts measurement: `getBoundingClientRect()` returns the visually
 * SCALED box, so the same English menu measured 252px on one pass and 257px on
 * another. `zoom-in-95` is the whole discrepancy (252/265 ~ 0.951).
 *
 * Awaiting `getAnimations({ subtree: true })` rather than sleeping a fixed
 * number of ms: tailwindcss-animate uses real CSS keyframe animations, which the
 * Web Animations API reports, so this settles exactly when they end instead of
 * guessing a duration that a future easing change would invalidate. The
 * geometry-stability pass afterwards covers anything the API does not report.
