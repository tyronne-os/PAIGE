"""KiroCrew packaging — plain setuptools build.

Package metadata, dependencies, and entry points live in ``setup.cfg`` and
``pyproject.toml``; this file only adds a custom ``build_py`` step that copies
the pre-built frontend assets from ``src/kiro_crew/static/dist`` into the
package.

The frontend is built separately with npm/Vite in the ``website/`` directory
and the resulting ``dist/`` is copied into ``src/kiro_crew/static/dist`` before
packaging. Vite emits content-hashed filenames that change on every build, so
``static/dist/`` is intentionally excluded from the ``package_data`` globs in
``setup.cfg``; we copy the directory tree directly here instead.
