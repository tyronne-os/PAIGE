"""In-memory governance health signal for the dashboard indicator.

A process-global record of the most recent governance fail-closed / integrity
incident, set on the audit path (``governance_profiles.audit_governance_degraded``
and ``admission._audit_admission_fail_closed``) and read by
``dashboard.state.status_snapshot`` to surface Active / Degraded / Disabled.

Deliberately tiny and dependency-free so both ``platform.admission`` and
``platform.governance_profiles`` can import it without an import cycle.  Purely
in-memory (resets on restart); the DURABLE record is the SEL
``governance_degraded`` audit event written alongside each mark.
