"""Seam-boundary LIVENESS bound for the ``CapabilityManager`` extension point.

The :class:`CapabilityManager` Protocol requires that every operation be
internally time-bounded so a slow companion op cannot stall MCP handlers. As
defense-in-depth the core ALSO wraps every mutation op with ``asyncio.wait_for``
here, and — critically — applies that wrapper at **context composition time**
(``PlatformContext.__post_init__``), NOT at a leaf dashboard accessor. That way
EVERY reader of ``current_context().capability_manager`` inherits the bound: the
dashboard handlers, and any future non-dashboard consumer (subagent, conductor,
MCP-tool code, an apps backend) that follows the documented CPP pattern of
reading the context directly. Enforcing it at the seam — where the contract is
declared — closes the gap where a new call site could obtain an unbounded
manager and reintroduce the exact hang class this exists to prevent.

The constants live here (not in a dashboard module) because the bound is now a
platform-layer contract; ``mcp.py`` imports ``CAPABILITY_UNINSTALL_TIMEOUT`` to
size its pre-lock uninstall phase budget from the same source of truth.

    """Wraps a ``CapabilityManager`` so every async MUTATION op is time-bounded
    with ``asyncio.wait_for``.

    Enforces the Protocol's LIVENESS contract ONCE at the seam boundary — the
    context is composed with this wrapper in ``PlatformContext.__post_init__``,
    so ``mcp.py`` uninstall, the ``agents.py`` capability handlers, and every
    future reader of ``current_context().capability_manager`` inherit the bound
    without having to remember it. Bounds are differentiated: uninstall ops are
    tight (:data:`CAPABILITY_UNINSTALL_TIMEOUT`), install ops are generous
    (:data:`CAPABILITY_INSTALL_TIMEOUT`) so a slow-but-legitimate package-manager
    download is not cancelled mid-mutation; the async READ ops
    (``list_*``/``registry``) are bounded by the tight
    :data:`CAPABILITY_READ_TIMEOUT`. Bounding reads too keeps the guarantee
    symmetric — the dashboard polls the list endpoints, so a stalled unbounded
    read would accumulate pending gateway tasks, the same wedge class the bound
    exists to prevent. Only the sync ``available()`` probe passes straight
    through (it does no I/O).

    An explicit proxy (not a ``__getattr__`` delegator) so a Protocol method
    added later surfaces as a loud ``AttributeError`` here rather than silently
    slipping past the bound — a maintenance trap is preferable to a silent hole
    in the liveness guarantee.
