"""Policy-only update provider seam for enterprise self-update.

Abstracts *how* Kiro Crew checks for and applies updates behind a single
operator-supplied :class:`CommandProvider`.

**Trust placement (security-critical).** A command provider runs unsandboxed
shell code AS THE GATEWAY. Its commands therefore live in exactly ONE place: the
keystone-protected ``security_policy.json`` (surfaced as ``UpdatePins`` via
:func:`~kiro_crew.platform.governance.active_update_pins`), which a
prompt-injected agent shell can neither read nor write. ``config.json`` and
environment variables are agent-writable / process-inherited, so they cannot
reach this seam at all — there is no config or env path into it.

**Selection is by PRESENCE, not by a mechanism name.** There is no mechanism
enum any more. :func:`resolve_provider` returns a :class:`CommandProvider` when
the policy pins define a check or apply command, and ``None`` otherwise (the
ungoverned default, where the gateway keeps its built-in update behaviour).

    or an ``apply_command`` (top-level or per-platform), a
    :class:`CommandProvider` is returned; otherwise ``None`` — the ungoverned
    default, where the gateway keeps its built-in update behaviour.
