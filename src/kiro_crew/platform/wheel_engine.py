"""Shadow-venv update engine for the ``cli.sh`` managed-venv install shape.

The managed venv (``${KIROCREW_HOME}-venv``) is the one install whose bytes the
gateway process is itself executing, so an in-place ``pip install --upgrade``
would overwrite a live runtime — the torn-runtime hazard
``docs/request-for-change/rfc-update-architecture.md`` §3 exists to prevent.
This module implements the versioned-trees-with-atomic-promotion design that
RFC's §3 reduced to invariants:

* **A new version is built into a FRESH sibling tree** (``crew-venv-<version>``)
  while the old gateway keeps serving from its own tree, untouched.
* **Promotion is a symlink replaced via ``os.replace``** — sibling symlink +
  ``rename(2)``, never ``ln -sfn`` (unlink+create has a missing-path window).
* **The stable path is a NEW NAME** (``crew-venv-current``) that has always
  been a symlink. The legacy fixed directory ``crew-venv`` is never renamed,
  moved, or converted: renaming it would break its own absolute shebangs while
  a gateway may still be running from it. It remains a functional fallback.
* **No tree a live process might be using is ever moved or deleted.** Pruning
  skips the stable link's target, the tree serving this process, and the
  legacy directory.

Authenticity comes from the same offline trust root ``cli.sh`` pins: the
channel feed serves an RSA-signed manifest, the signature is verified against
the public key embedded below (byte-identical to ``cli.sh``'s copy — a drift
test reads both), and the wheel's SHA-256 must match the SIGNED digest. The
feed alone is never trusted for anything actionable.

What this engine deliberately does NOT change, stated for parity rather than
guarded against: the shadow ``pip install`` resolves the wheel's dependencies
from the index exactly as ``cli.sh``'s own venv branch does today, so the
provenance story covers the Kiro Crew wheel itself, not the dependency set.
Raising that bar (hash-pinned constraints inside the signed payload) is worth
doing for the installer and this engine together, not here alone.
