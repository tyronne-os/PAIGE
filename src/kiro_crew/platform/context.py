"""The PlatformContext composition object and the active-context accessor.

KiroCrew uses the Composed Platform Providers (CPP) model to share one core
between the public open-source edition and the Amazon-internal companion.  The
public core defines a set of *extension points* — interfaces in
``kiro_crew.platform.interfaces`` — and ships a ``Default*`` adapter for each
that reproduces today's open-source behavior.  An internal companion package
supplies Amazon adapters for the same interfaces.

The :class:`PlatformContext` is the frozen object, built once at boot, that
holds the chosen adapter for every extension point.  Core code reads only from
the context (directly when it has it, or via :func:`current_context` for
module-level functions), so the public core never names an Amazon class.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/platform-context.md``.

# A field listed here is part of the published contract but has NO consumption
# site in the core: overriding it changes NOTHING.  The declaration lives HERE,
# next to the dataclass an implementor actually reads, because the previous
# "NOT YET WIRED" notes were buried in ``interfaces.py``/``defaults.py``
# docstrings — invisible from the composition root where an edition author
# writes ``dataclasses.replace(ctx, package_manager=MyPackageManager())`` and
# gets silence.
#
# Two enforcement arms keep this honest and rot-proof, both in
# ``test_platform_cpp_seam_coverage.py``:
#
#   1. Every ``PlatformContext`` field must be EITHER consumed by non-platform
#      core code OR listed here.  A new field with no consumption site fails the
#      build instead of becoming the next dead seam.
#   2. A field listed here must have NO non-platform consumption site.  So
#      wiring a reserved slot fails the build until its entry is deliberately
#      REMOVED from this map — the marker cannot silently outlive the inertness
#      it documents.
#
# At runtime, ``PlatformContext.__post_init__`` logs one loud warning per
# reserved slot that carries a non-default value (see ``_warn_reserved_slots``).

# forward-looking, harmless override into a boot failure — a breaking change for

#
# ``installed_context()`` is the one context accessor that does NOT take the
# fail-closed path: where ``current_context()`` refuses to compose open-source
# defaults on a non-standalone host, the peek simply answers ``None``.  That is
# safe only where the no-context answer is already the conservative one — and
# that is a property of the CALLER, not of this function, so the function cannot
# check it.
#
# For a while nothing did.  The contract lived in the docstring below and in
# ``docs/system-specs/modules/platform-context.md``, and the caller set grew from
# one to three with nothing objecting — the spec sentence naming "the one such
# caller" was still describing a set of three.
#
# So the caller set is declared HERE and gated by
# ``test_platform_cpp_seam_coverage.py``, the same declared-map-plus-AST-scan
# shape :data:`RESERVED_SLOTS` uses, rot-proof in both directions:
#
#   1. Every call site of ``installed_context()`` in the package must appear in
#      this map.  A new peek fails the build until its author writes down why ITS
#      no-context answer is conservative — the review question the docstring
#      could only ask politely.
#   2. Every entry must still have a real call site.  A caller that is deleted or
#      renamed takes its entry with it, so the map cannot decay into a list of
#      permissions nobody exercises.
#
# The gate is a forcing function, not a proof: it cannot verify that a written
# justification is TRUE.  What it removes is the silent path — adding a peek now
# costs a diff to the very file whose fail-closed contract is being bypassed, and
# every justification lands in front of a reviewer.
#
# Keys are ``"<path under src/kiro_crew>::<enclosing function>"``.  Each value
# must contain the phrase ``no-context answer`` so the justification is greppable
# and cannot dodge the question it exists to answer.

    propagates :class:`PlatformCompositionError` to the caller.

    Why a log site needs its own spelling. ``redact_via_context`` re-raises that
    error deliberately: for an EGRESS sink, refusing to send is both safe and the
    whole point. A gate-side log line is not an egress boundary, and there the
    same raise buys nothing while costing availability -- several of these sites
    log from a path whose failure is worse than a missing line (a background
    drain, a boot-time install step, an audit write).

    The two no-companion states are NOT the same, and conflating them is what
    makes this helper subtle:

    * **A context is installed but its policy could not be composed.** The host
      is known to be non-standalone and its companion genuinely failed, so the
      baseline would be a real downgrade -- exactly what
      ``redact_via_context``'s fail-closed contract exists to forbid. The line's
      TEXT is withheld (:data:`LOG_WITHHELD_PLACEHOLDER`): strictly safer than
      either raising or downgrading, and the caller's own log call still records
      that a line arrived and why its content is absent. Same shape as
      ``auto_improvement.backend.mcp_server._redact_result``.
    * **No context is installed at all.** Nothing here evidences a companion,
      the full OSS pass still runs, and this is byte-for-byte what the site did
      before it adopted this helper -- so withholding would DESTROY diagnostics
      to protect against a companion that may not exist. Baseline it is. A
      process that deliberately does not compose (``mcp_gateway.gatewayd`` is
      one: see ``mcp_gateway/app_call.py``, "this daemon is not the composition
      process") therefore keeps its logs, and closing that residual properly
      means handing such a process a composed context -- a separate change, and
      the same remedy that module already names for the security ceiling.

    Transient (non-composition) adapter errors degrade to baseline, inherited
    from ``redact_via_context``, so a merely flaky companion does not blank the
    logs either.

    Costs NO I/O per call. ``installed_context()`` is a bare attribute read, and
    it is the right primitive here for the reason its own contract gives -- the
    no-context answer is the SAME as the default-context answer, since
    ``DefaultCredentialPolicy.redact`` delegates to ``security.redact``, so
    resolving one would be pure cost. That matters because
    ``current_context()`` never memoizes its fail-closed verdict on a
    non-standalone profile, so a per-line caller reaching it would re-pay a
    config load and an entry-point discovery for every line on the event loop
    (``docs/system-specs/modules/platform-context.md`` calls this out). Once a
    context IS installed the delegation below is also just an attribute read, so
    no path resolves.

    Callers keep their own truncation, and must apply it AFTER this returns:
    slicing a redacted string is what keeps a credential from surviving as an
    unmatchable fragment.
