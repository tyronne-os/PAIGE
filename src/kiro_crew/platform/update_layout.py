    Composed locally from validated inputs — never from feed data.

    The installer is held in a shell VARIABLE and never lands on disk, which has
    to satisfy two constraints that pull against each other.

    1. A download failure must fail the command. Plain ``curl … | sh`` reports
       the exit status of ``sh``, and a shell handed empty input exits 0, so a
       CDN failure would look like a successful update: the version would not
       change, the gateway would restart, the check would still see an update
       available, and the unattended path would loop. Assigning the body in a
       command substitution first makes the fetch's own failure abort the
       command, portably — ``pipefail`` is not POSIX and the resolved ``sh`` is
       not guaranteed to be bash.

    2. No writable file may sit between download and execute. Staging to
       ``mktemp`` opened a TOCTOU window: the gateway and an agent share a uid,
       so the file's 0600 mode does not keep the agent out, and it could swap
       the contents after ``curl`` wrote them and before ``sh`` opened them —
       arbitrary code in the gateway's own context. Keeping the body in memory
       removes the window rather than trying to police it.

    ``-s --`` is required here and only here: it tells ``sh`` to read the script
    from stdin and to pass what follows to that script. The file form must NOT
    carry it, since ``cli.sh`` parses argv strictly and answers
    "unknown argument '-s'" with exit 2.
