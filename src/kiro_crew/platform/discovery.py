"""Fail-closed companion discovery via ``importlib.metadata`` entry points.

A non-standalone edition is supplied by a companion package that registers a
``kirocrew.plugins`` entry point pointing at its composition root
(``build_enterprise_context``).  Discovery is **fail-closed**: when the profile is
non-standalone but no compatible companion is found, boot aborts rather than silently
running with the open-source defaults (which could drop a security overlay).
