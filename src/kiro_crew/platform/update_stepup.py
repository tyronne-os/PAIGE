"""Host-local step-up for the dashboard's in-app wheel update (RFC OQ7).

A dashboard session is NOT sufficient authority to install code: IP pinning
breaks under every same-host proxy, which makes the
session token an effectively transferable bearer for remote access. Acceptable
for chat and operations; not for replacing the gateway's own bytes. So the
in-app Apply is split into two actions with different authority:

* **Arm** (the SPA can do this): record a pending update request and write a
  single-use approval nonce to a file in the data home. The nonce never
  travels to the SPA — the arm response carries a request id and the command
  to run, nothing that approves anything.
* **Approve** (only the host can do this): ``kirocrew update approve`` reads
  the nonce from that file and presents it back to the gateway. Reading the
  file requires filesystem access as the gateway's own user, which is exactly
  the identity the step-up exists to prove. A remote dashboard bearer cannot
  read the gateway host's disk, so it cannot mint an approval.

What this deliberately does NOT defend against, per the RFC's security
section: local code execution as the gateway's user. An on-host process that
can read the data home can approve an update — and can equally replace the
venv directly. The adversary this mechanism is about is the network-reachable
dashboard bearer, and against that one the file is a real boundary.

The nonce file is the ONLY state. The gateway holds nothing in memory, so an
armed request survives nothing it shouldn't: a gateway restart discards it
(the file's TTL still bounds it), and two arms overwrite — last writer wins,
which is fine because arming grants nothing by itself.

#: How long an armed request stays approvable. RFC OQ7 names ~10 minutes:
#: long enough to switch to a terminal, short enough that a forgotten arm
#: does not linger as a standing approval-in-waiting.
PENDING_TTL_SECS = 600

#: Lives under the data home's ``trust/`` directory — a whole-directory
#: keystone leaf (``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``), so the agent's file gate
#: and every bash form (cat/tee/redirect/extract) refuse it. Without the
#: fence, a remote dashboard bearer could instruct the agent to read the
#: nonce and POST the approval, collapsing the two authorities this split
#: exists to keep apart. The gateway writes it directly (keystone readers
#: never route through is_sensitive_path), so arming is unaffected.
_PENDING_FILENAME = "pending-update-approval.json"

#: Serializes every read-validate-remove of the nonce file against arm's
#: atomic swap. Arm and approve run as concurrent executor threads in ONE
#: gateway process (see arm's temp-name comment), so without this an approve
#: that validated request A could unlink a request B that arm swapped in
#: between the read and the unlink — accepting A while silently destroying B.
#: The approval/consumption write plane lives entirely in the gateway, so an
#: in-process lock closes it. One reader lives elsewhere: `kirocrew update
#: approve` calls read_pending() from its own CLI process, outside this lock.
#: Reading never writes by default (clear_expired=False), so that caller
#: cannot write at all — the lock covers every writer that exists.
