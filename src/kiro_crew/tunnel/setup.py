    Returns the TunnelManager if started, None if denied. Lifecycle
    (``start`` / ``stop`` / ``public_url``) routes through the active
    ``TunnelProvider`` seam inside ``TunnelManager``; the public core's Default
    provider is a no-op so the OSS build stays disabled, while a companion drives
    a real tunnel. The connect/disconnect callbacks below (CORS + ``set_tunnel_url``)
    and ``/api/tunnel/status`` stay wrapped AROUND the provider.

    Two deny gates are evaluated BEFORE the manager is constructed or ``start()``
    reached, so nothing can publish past either one:

    * ``publish_disabled()`` — the ``--no-tunnel`` boot flag. This instance must
      publish no tunnel at all, whatever the config says. It is checked
      FIRST because it is the stronger statement: token auth being present does
      not make publishing acceptable for an instance whose launcher asked for
      none. This is the boot door; ``slack.allowlist`` guards the on-demand one
      against the same predicate.
    * token auth — a companion tunnel can never start without dashboard token
      auth.

    Every other dependency is passed explicitly — no implicit imports from
    dashboard. The boot flag is the exception by design: it is process state, read
    from this package's own module (see ``tunnel.set_publish_disabled``), because
    more than one door has to consult it and a parameter would leave each new one
    unguarded by default.
