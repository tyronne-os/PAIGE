"""Tunnel lifecycle manager — thin wrapper over the ``TunnelProvider`` seam.

``TunnelManager`` owns the edition-neutral wiring the dashboard needs (name
computation, the connect/disconnect CORS reflection callbacks, the
``/api/tunnel/status`` snapshot) and delegates the actual lifecycle —
``start`` / ``stop`` / ``public_url`` — UNCONDITIONALLY to
``current_context().tunnel``.  There is deliberately NO edition/identity branch
here: the public core ships ``DefaultTunnelProvider`` (a no-op), so the
open-source build stays byte-identical (the tunnel is disabled and reports
"not available in OSS"); the Amazon companion composes a real
``TunnelProvider`` and the same manager drives it.

To expose the dashboard remotely on the open-source build, run your own reverse
proxy / tunnel (for example ``ssh -R``, ``cloudflared``, ``ngrok``) in front of
the dashboard port.

    Lifecycle (``start`` / ``stop`` / ``public_url``) delegates UNCONDITIONALLY
    to ``current_context().tunnel`` — there is no ``isinstance``/identity check
    against the Default provider (that would be an edition branch by proxy).  The
    public core's ``DefaultTunnelProvider`` is a no-op, so on the open-source
    build ``start()`` leaves the tunnel disabled and reports "not available in
    OSS"; a companion's provider drives a real tunnel through the same calls.

    The connect/disconnect CORS-reflection callbacks and the
    ``/api/tunnel/status`` snapshot stay wrapped AROUND the provider: the manager
    registers the callbacks with the provider on ``start`` and, for status,
    prefers the provider's live snapshot but falls back to its own local
    ``TunnelStatus`` (which is what the Default provider yields → byte-identical
    standalone output).

    Precedence: an explicit local lifecycle write WINS over the provider
    snapshot.  ``stop()`` (STOPPED) and the OSS-disabled ``start()`` (DISABLED)
    pin the local status so a stale/lagging snapshot cannot resurrect a
    "connected" state after the tunnel is torn down; a subsequent ``start()``
    that a live provider actually drives clears the pin so the snapshot flows
    again.
