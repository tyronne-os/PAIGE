"""The catalogue of monitored kinds, each registered as DATA.

The four boundaries that gate a kind read this table instead of naming a kind
themselves: an enum in the tool schema, a frozenset in the validator, an ``if`` in
the HTTP handler, and the ``if`` on the persistence-only path. Without it, adding a
kind means finding all four, every one of them a place to forget.

The claim is scoped to those four deliberately. Other spellings of a kind or an
objective survive elsewhere -- a reason code in the GitHub observation, the irq
subsystem's own dispatch -- and this module does not reach them.

This module holds one entry per kind and the boundaries ask it. Two properties are
worth separating carefully, because collapsing them is how a new kind acquires a
claim nobody checked:

**Objectives are declared BY THE KIND, not drawn from a shared vocabulary.** There
is no global objective enum here. ``review_ready`` means "the pull request is ready
for a human to look at", which is not a sentence about a calendar or a ticket, and a
shared list would make every new kind edit a common set -- the same defect as a
dispatch branch, moved to a different file.

**A capability is something a kind ANSWERS FOR, not something the registry polices.**
``supports_shadow`` says the persistence-only path is implemented for this kind. That
is a statement about what code exists, not about what a caller may ask for, so it
belongs to the kind. Modelled as an allowlist instead, a kind added later would
silently inherit a claim about a path it has never run.

Deliberately DATA only: no probe factories and no imports of any kind's
implementation. ``kiro_crew.validation`` imports this module, and it is imported by
almost everything, so pulling a provider's transitive dependencies in here would
make a validator drag a GitHub client behind it.

#: The structured monitor a caller arms through ``monitor_watch``. Its subject is a
#: public GitHub pull request and its objective is review readiness.
GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST = "github_pull_request"

#: The observation-gated babysit watch. Armed only INTERNALLY, from a loop's own
#: message text via ``probes.targets.infer``, never by a caller naming it, which is
#: why it is registered but not publicly armable.
#: Spelled here as data rather than imported: ``probes/__init__.py`` owns the same
#: string for the irq subsystem, and the two packages have no import edge in either
#: direction today. Introducing one for a constant would couple them ahead of the
#: porting work that unifies the vocabularies. ``test_monitor_kind_registry`` asserts
#: the two spellings agree, so a drift fails loudly instead of silently.
GH_PR = "gh-pr"

#: A public GitHub Actions workflow run. A genuinely different subject from a pull
#: request: its terminal states are success / failure / cancelled / timed_out, not
#: merged or closed. Registered but NOT publicly armable, because a workflow run
#: cannot be inferred from a message by URL the way a pull request can, so a caller
#: has no way to name one -- see the note on ``publicly_armable`` below for whether
#: that is a property of the subject or a limit still to lift.
GITHUB_WORKFLOW_RUN = "github_workflow_run"

REVIEW_READY = "review_ready"

#: What a workflow run's completion IS. Declared by the workflow-run kind alone, not
#: drawn from a shared vocabulary: ``review_ready`` means "a human can look at this
#: pull request now", which is not a sentence about a run. A run's objective is that
#: it REACHED a conclusion, whatever that conclusion turns out to be.
