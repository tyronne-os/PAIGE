        Reads the samples the reaper sweep already takes (``_sample_live_costs``,
        every ``_REAPER_INTERVAL`` seconds) — this method itself does no ``/proc``
        work, so it is safe on the event loop. ``rss_mb`` is 0.0 until the first
        sweep observes the agent, which is why ``sampled`` is reported separately:
        a fresh task genuinely has no measurement yet, and rendering that as
        "0 MB" would be a lie.

        ``shared`` mirrors ``_session_sharing``: the value is that runtime's
        measurement divided by the number of concurrently-live sharing sessions
        on the same pid, i.e. an average share, not an exclusive figure. The same
        split applies to ``procs``/``mcp`` (see ``_attributed_count``), which are
        null until a sweep has counted them — a task row that reported no MCP
        stubs because the field was simply absent read as "subagents do not use
        the MCP pool", which is the opposite of what they do.
