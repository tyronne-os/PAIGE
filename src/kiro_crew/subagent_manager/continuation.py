        error, timeout, cancel-recovery, reaper), all guarded by a carefully
        ordered 3-guard finally — a watcher observes the outcome without

        popped from ``self._tasks`` too, so teardown (session release) has
        finished before the continuation tries to reuse the conversation; any
        residual ``conversation_busy`` gets a bounded retry.

        completion event through the normal ``_on_done`` path — the parent
        must not wait forever on an event that is not coming.

        Hard-bounded and manager-owned: gives up at the manager's run timeout
        plus a margin, and the task is registered in ``_followup_watchers`` so
