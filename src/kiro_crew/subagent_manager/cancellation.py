        """Respawn *info*'s run on a fresh task after an unexpected cancellation.

        Called from ``_run``'s CancelledError handler — the current task is
        being cancelled and cannot continue itself, so the continuation runs on
        a new task. One-shot: gated by ``info._cancel_retry_used`` at the call
        site. The original run's finally block still performs session cleanup
        (release/reset) but skips terminal finalization while ``_recovering``.

        **Cancellation-source contract.** This branch exists for cancellations
        that arrive from OUTSIDE the manager's own lifecycle — in practice the
        parent task tree being torn down around a live subagent (e.g. a
        dashboard slot reset/removal cancelling background tasks, or an event
        during gateway component re-init) — mirroring the main path's
        unexpected-cancel recovery. Every INTENTIONAL cancel site in
        this module sets a terminal marker before cancelling, and the recovery
        branch defers to all of them: ``cancel()`` sets ``user_stopped``,
        ``cancel_all()`` sets ``_shutting_down``, and ``_force_reap`` sets
        ``reaped`` (checked before the recovery branch). Any NEW code path that
        cancels a subagent task on purpose MUST set one of those markers first,
        or the cancel will be treated as unexpected and recovered once.

        Coordination is explicit, not timed: ``_resume`` awaits the ORIGINAL
        task object to fully complete (its finally does session release/reset,
        slot decrement, and pops the task registry) before respawning. This
        guarantees the old finally can neither pop the new task out of
        ``self._tasks`` nor emit a duplicate completion, and the respawn never
        starts against a session whose reset is still in flight. The respawn
        then re-acquires a slot by waiting for capacity (the old finally's
        ``_drain_queue`` may have admitted a queued spawn into the freed slot),
        so the concurrency ceiling is never exceeded.

        The pending ``_resume`` task itself is registered in ``self._tasks``
        (under ``"<id>:recovery"``) so ``cancel_all()`` reaches it during
        shutdown — a recovery can never outlive or escape manager teardown.
