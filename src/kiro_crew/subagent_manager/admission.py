        Approval priority (first match wins):

        1. YOLO mode → immediate execution
        2. ``approval_mode="auto"`` from caller → immediate execution
        3. parent session trust (``approval_policy == "auto"``, the dashboard
           Trust toggle) → auto-approved execution
        4. ``auto_approve_subagent_spawn`` config → auto-approved execution
        5. ``on_spawn_approval`` callback → interactive approval, unless the
           callback reports it has no surface to raise the prompt on, in which
           case the spawn is refused immediately (see
           ``_spawn_with_approval_impl``)
        6. Otherwise → rejected

        When ``approval_mode="auto"`` is set, it has two effects:
        - Skips the spawn approval gate (this method)
        - Sets the subagent's session-level tool approval policy to
          "auto" in ``_run_inner()``, meaning all tool calls within
          the subagent are auto-approved for its entire lifetime.

        This dual behavior is intentional for headless callers (e.g.
        Mochi bg agent) that have no UI to respond to approval prompts.
        The parameter is only accepted via the internal ``POST /api/spawn``
        endpoint (requires X-Internal-Secret), not from LLM tool calls.

        Args:
            task (str): The prompt/task description for the subagent.
            parent_session_key (str): Session key of the caller.
            agent (str): Agent name override (default: "kirocrew").
            model (str): Model override for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            reasoning_effort (str): Per-call reasoning-effort override; wins
                over the ``role_efforts['subagent']`` pin. ``""`` defers to it.
            allowed_tools (list): Tool allowlist for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            bare (bool): Launch CC in bare mode (ignored for ACP).
            cwd (str): Optional absolute path where the subagent subprocess
                launches instead of the default ``subagent_<id>`` sandbox.
                Validated against ``AgentConfig.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots``;
                rejected spawns return a done ``SubagentInfo`` with ``error``
                set. Enables cwd-relative resource globs (``AGENTS.md``,
                ``.kiro/steering``, ``CLAUDE.md``) to resolve correctly.
            approval_mode (str | None): "auto" to skip spawn gate and
                set session-level auto-approve.  Only honored from
                authenticated internal callers (X-Internal-Secret).
            silent (bool): Suppress completion notifications.

        Returns:
            SubagentInfo | None: Agent metadata, or None if at capacity.
