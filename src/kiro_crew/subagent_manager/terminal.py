        ``finally`` call this and report only if it returns True, so the parent
        is notified exactly once no matter which wins the race or whether the
        loser is cancelled part-way through its teardown.

        Contains no ``await``, so on a single-threaded event loop the
        check-and-set is atomic with respect to other tasks.

        Returns False while ``_recovering`` — a cancel-recovery respawn is
        pending and the agent must not be reported done yet — leaving the claim
        OPEN so the respawned run can take it later.

        ``supersede_recovery=True`` overrides that withholding and is used ONLY
        by definitively-terminal callers (`_force_reap`, which also serves user
        Stop). Without it a reap landing inside the recovery window stranded the
        outcome: the reap was refused the claim, performed teardown and set
        ``reaped``, reported nothing — and `_resume`'s ``reaped`` abort path
        bare-returns, so no path ever reported and the agent sat unfinished
        until the reaper's wall-clock deadline. Superseding also clears
        ``_recovering``, because a killed agent has nothing left to respawn.

        Scope note: this token governs REPORTING only, and it deliberately does
        NOT consult ``info.done``. Gating it on ``done`` is wrong:
        if ``_run_inner`` set ``done`` while the reap awaited its session reset,
        the reaper refused the claim, still marked ``reaped``, and ``_run``'s
        finally then skipped its own claim — nobody reported. The terminal RECORD
        (tombstone/stat) keeps its own ``not info.done`` guard and slot accounting
        has its own one-shot token (:meth:`_release_slot`); three concerns, three
        guards. Session teardown stays keyed on ``reaped``.

        This is the exact work the finalize claim guards: fire the
        ``subagent_done`` WS event, then inject the completion into the parent
        (``_on_done``) with its ``_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`` cap, timeout handling, and
        (for the ``_run`` path) the result.txt TTL / workspace-cleanup
        bookkeeping.

        Why this is a separate coroutine run under ``asyncio.shield`` (see
        ``_run_terminal_report``): the claim makes reporting EXCLUSIVE but not
        ATOMIC. A claimer cancelled mid-report (``_force_reap`` /
        ``cancel_all()`` cancelling the task while it awaits ``_fire_event`` or
        ``_on_done``) would exit without delivering, and the other path — seeing
        the claim already taken — stays silent, so the completed outcome never
        reaches the parent. Running the report on a shielded, strongly-held task
        makes it complete independently of caller cancellation.

        The two call sites (reap vs. ``_run``'s ``finally``) differ only in the
        injection-timeout reason string, the log ``source`` prefix, and whether
        a successful delivery marks the result delivered — those are passed as
        arguments rather than unified away. The WS payload is identical (both
        set ``info.elapsed`` before calling), so it is built from ``info`` here.
