# ── Canonical "[OPTIONS: a | b | c]" trailer parsers ────────────────────────
# The agent emits a trailing ``[OPTIONS: choice1 | choice2 | ...]`` marker that
# every surface renders as tappable choices. Two variants exist because the
# surfaces scan differently, but their GRAMMAR must stay identical — so both are
# defined here ONCE and imported everywhere: a hand-mirrored copy risks a
# one-character slip that flips the flag semantics or reintroduces the ReDoS
# class below on a single surface.
#
# Body: a TEMPERED greedy repetition. No alternative in it may consume a ``[``
# that begins a fresh ``[OPTIONS:`` — both bracket forms carry that guard. This
# matters for ReDoS (py/polynomial-redos): a plain greedy ``.*`` body can itself
# consume a ``[`` that also starts the outer ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so over
# untrusted text with many ``[OPTIONS:`` prefixes ``search()``/``findall()``
# re-explore the body from each position — polynomial backtracking. The tempered
# body is unambiguous (linear) while still capturing an inner ``[`` inside an
# option ("Fix [x] logging", "a[1]"). A CLOSER is admitted CONDITIONALLY, not
# freely: only where an earlier ``[`` in the same label matches it or the label
# list continues after it (see :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES` for why
# an unconditional ``]`` made the body run past the marker and delete prose).
# This parser runs over untrusted LLM/relayed text before Slack, the dashboard,
# Discord, Telegram, and WeCom render it.
#
# LINE (``re.MULTILINE``, ``$`` anchor) — for Slack/dashboard, where the marker
# ends a LINE (not necessarily the whole message). The negated class EXCLUDES
# ``\n`` (``[^[\n]``): in Python ``re`` a negated class matches ``\n`` regardless
# of DOTALL, so ``[^[]`` here would silently widen the single-line body to span
# lines (deleting/splitting a multi-line span the old single-line ``.*`` never
# matched). Trailing class is ``[ \t]`` (NOT ``\s``, which under MULTILINE would
# also match ``\n``).
#
# OPTIONAL MARKDOWN-LINK CLOSE ``(?:\(...\))?`` after the ``]``: models sometimes
# append a stray ``(OPTIONS)`` (or any ``(...)``) right after the marker, e.g.
# ``[OPTIONS: A | B | C](OPTIONS)``. That does TWO bad things at once: the extra
# text after ``]`` breaks the end anchor so the marker leaks unparsed, AND
# ``[label](url)`` is valid Markdown so the dashboard renders the whole thing as a
# clickable link instead of buttons. Absorbing a single tightly-attached ``(...)``
# here (it stays OUTSIDE the captured label group, so choices are unaffected)
# makes the parser resilient to that tic. The ``(`` must follow the ``]`` with no
# gap, so genuine trailing prose (``] and then...``) or a spaced note (``] (note)``)
# still fails the anchor and is left intact — the deliberate "trailing note on the
# same line" behaviour is preserved. The inner class is ``[^\s()]`` (NOT ``[^)\n]``)
# so it shares NO character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` — that keeps the added group
# unambiguous and avoids a polynomial-ReDoS (``py/polynomial-redos``) backtracking
# path over ``[OPTIONS:`` + a long whitespace run. The real tic (``(OPTIONS)``, a
# bare ``(url)``) contains no whitespace or nested parens, so nothing is lost.
#: Closing brackets accepted on a protocol marker. ASCII ``]`` is the only form
#: the prompt ever specifies, but a model intermittently substitutes a fullwidth
#: or CJK lookalike — U+3011 ``】`` is the observed one; U+FF3D ``］`` and U+3015
#: ``〕`` are the same class of slip. A single wrong codepoint otherwise breaks
#: the end anchor, so the whole marker leaks into the visible message as literal
#: text and the turn silently loses its follow-up pills. Label content is
#: unaffected either way, so accepting the lookalike costs nothing.
#:
#: ONE definition, shared by both regexes below. Deliberately NOT used by
#: :func:`split_trailing_protocol_suffix`'s unfinished-marker check, which stays
#: ASCII-only on purpose -- see the comment there. That asymmetry is the point:
#: completeness is decided by the trailer regex, not by whether some closer
#: character happens to appear in the tail.
#:
#: ReDoS profile is the same as a bare literal ``\]``. The class shares
#: no character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*``, and the body excludes it
#: from its negated class and readmits it in exactly TWO places, both of which a
#: widening of this constant has to be re-audited against: as the final atom of
#: :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR`, and via :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES`. Those two
#: are what the disjointness argument is about (see :data:`_MARKER_BODY_LINE`),
#: so the pair form -- which is where the deciding lookahead lives -- is the one
#: NOT to skip. Both readmit all four codepoints at once, which is why adding
#: these three introduces no ambiguity that ASCII ``]`` did not already have.
MARKER_CLOSERS = "]\u3011\uff3d\u3015"
_MARKER_CLOSE_CLASS = "[" + re.escape(MARKER_CLOSERS) + "]"

#: Markdown WRAPPER characters tolerated around a complete marker line.
#: A model sometimes wraps the whole marker in inline code or emphasis --
#: ``\`[OPTIONS: A | B]\``` or ``**[OPTIONS: A | B]**``. The wrapper character
#: lands AFTER the closer, breaks the end anchor, and the marker leaks into the
#: visible message as literal text while the turn silently loses its pills --
#: the same class of model tic as the stray ``](OPTIONS)`` suffix the grammar
#: already absorbs. Scope is deliberately tight so real prose never matches:
#: a LEADING wrapper is accepted only at line start (after optional indent), so
#: emphasis belonging to preceding prose (``**Choose:** [OPTIONS: ...]``) is
#: never eaten, and a TRAILING wrapper only when the marker itself OPENED one:
#: the ``(?(lwrap)...)`` conditional arms only when the ``lwrap`` group
#: captured a nonempty line-leading run. This is the invariant that makes every
#: reviewed corruption shape unreachable at once (mid-line code span
#: ``\`Use [OPTIONS: A | B]\```, a streaming frame's stray run, a MULTILINE
#: emphasis closer ``**Choose one\n[OPTIONS: A | B]**``): a run at line start
#: can only OPEN emphasis under CommonMark flanking rules (preceded by a
#: newline, it is not right-flanking), while a run after the closer can only
#: CLOSE something -- and if the marker did not open it, it belongs to the
#: enclosing prose and must survive the strip. A bare or mid-line marker keeps
#: the pre-widening grammar exactly. Leading-only stays absorbed (nothing
#: follows the closer, so nothing can be stolen); trailing-only does not
#: match and renders literally, as it did before the widening. Runs are capped
#: at 3 (``***`` is the longest CommonMark emphasis run; 4+ is not a wrapper).
#:
#: ReDoS profile unchanged: the class shares no character with the trailing
#: ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*`` or the indent class, and both wrapper positions are
#: anchored by the required ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so no new ambiguity exists.
MARKER_WRAPPERS = "`*_"
_MARKER_WRAP_CLASS = "[" + re.escape(MARKER_WRAPPERS) + "]"

#: A closer may stay INSIDE a label only where it CONTINUES the label list
#: A label may legitimately carry a closer -- ``[OPTIONS: Alpha ] |
#: Bravo ]]`` is a supported shape -- so the body has to admit one. Admitting it
#: UNCONDITIONALLY (the old ``[^[\n]``, which includes ``]``) made the body run to
#: the LAST closer in range instead of the first plausible one, so an ordinary
#: final line that mentions a bracket after the marker matched across BOTH:
#:
#:     Use [OPTIONS: A | B] then check arr[0]
#:
#: matched whole, and since every consumer removes the whole match -- ``slack.
#: format`` and ``messaging.renderer`` cut the visible text at ``match.start()``,
#: and ``whatsapp.turn_renderer`` PERSISTS the cut turn -- the sentence vanished
#: from the message and came back as a pill label. Under TRAILER (``DOTALL``) the
#: body crossed blank lines too, so the whole final paragraph went with it.
#:
#: This is the SAME discriminator the streaming probe already applies
#: (``CONTINUES_LABELS_RE`` in ``website/src/app-sdk/protocol/optionMarker.ts``)
#: to decide whether an arriving closer ended the marker, so the regex and the
#: probe now answer that question the same way instead of two different ways.
#:
#: Continuation ALONE is too strict, though: ``[OPTIONS: Fix [x] logging |
#: Skip]`` is a first-class supported shape (pinned by
#: ``test_options_buttons.py`` and ``test_parse_options.py``, whose comments say
#: so outright), and there the closer is followed by an ordinary word. So the
#: body admits a closer under EITHER of two conditions -- it is MATCHED by a
#: ``[`` earlier in the same label (:data:`_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR`), or the list
#: CONTINUES after it (:data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES`). Neither test alone
#: separates the three shapes; the union does:
#:
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix [x] logging | Skip]   matched pair      -> parses
#:     [OPTIONS: Alpha ] | Bravo ]]        list continues    -> parses
#:     Use [OPTIONS: A | B] then check arr[0]   neither      -> declined
#:
#: The two alternatives are made disjoint by what FOLLOWS the closer -- the pair
#: form requires that its closer NOT be followed by a separator or another
#: closer, which is exactly when the continuation form applies. So no span of
#: input ever has two parses, which is what keeps the body linear despite two
#: bracket alternatives (see :data:`_MARKER_BODY_LINE`).
#:
#: RESIDUAL COST. Every shape the union gives up is a closer that satisfies
#: NEITHER half and has ordinary words after it, so at that closer the input is
#: genuinely indistinguishable from "marker ended, prose followed on the same
#: line". There is more than one way to be that closer, and all of them parsed
#: on the old body:
#:
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix ]x logging | Skip]            unmatched -- no ``[`` at all
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix list[dict[str, Any]] now | S] nesting deeper than one level
#:     [OPTIONS: 【重要】修复 | 跳过】               a lookalike PAIR: ``【`` is not
#:                                                 an opener, only ``[`` is
#:     [OPTIONS: Fix [multi\nline] now | Skip]     TRAILER only -- the pair
#:                                                 interior excludes ``\n`` even
#:                                                 under DOTALL
#:
#: All four fail toward a VISIBLE marker, not toward deleted prose, and that
#: asymmetry is what makes them affordable: the user sees the marker they were
#: already seeing for the broken shapes, and nothing is removed from the
#: message. Making them parse means matching brackets to arbitrary depth and
#: over an opener set this grammar does not have, which a regex is the wrong
#: tool for; the cost is bounded instead by the direction it fails in.
#:
#: A declined marker leaves the text intact only because every partial-cut gate
#: downstream tests for a closer over :data:`MARKER_CLOSERS` rather than ASCII
#: ``]`` -- see the gate in ``messaging.renderer.split_options_trailer``, which
#: this rule is what made load-bearing.
#:
#: NOT reachable by this rule, and deliberately unchanged: the separator-tail
#: form (``Done. [OPTIONS: Merge | Wait], details in CHANGELOG[1]``). ``], ``
#: DOES continue the list, by the very rule that makes ``[OPTIONS: Alpha ],
#: Bravo]`` legal, so no guard applied at the internal closer can tell them
#: apart. Resolving it means deciding which shape loses -- a separate call.
_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES = rf"(?=[ \t]*[|,]|{_MARKER_CLOSE_CLASS})"

#: A closer MATCHED by a ``[`` earlier in the same label. One level deep, and its
#: interior excludes ``[`` and EVERY closer (not just ASCII ``]``, so a lookalike
#: cannot be swallowed into the interior and escape the rule), which makes its
#: match from any given ``[`` unique. The trailing negative lookahead is what
#: makes this disjoint from :data:`_MARKER_LABEL_CONTINUES` rather than an
#: alternative spelling of it.
#:
#: The opening ``\[`` carries the SAME ``(?!OPTIONS:)`` guard as the bare-``[``
#: alternative, and for the same reason: without it this form is the one place
#: the union rule is LOOSER than the body it replaced, because it can open on a
#: nested head and pair it with that head's own closer. ``Note [OPTIONS: see
#: [OPTIONS: x] below | Skip]`` then matches from the OUTER head -- where the
#: old body matched nothing at all -- and renders a pill whose label is a raw
#: protocol marker, echoed back as the user's reply when tapped. The guard
#: restores "no bracket form may consume a ``[`` that begins a fresh
#: ``[OPTIONS:``" as an absolute property of the body rather than one that holds
#: only for sibling heads.
_MARKER_LABEL_PAIR = (
    rf"\[(?!OPTIONS:)[^[{re.escape(MARKER_CLOSERS)}\n]*{_MARKER_CLOSE_CLASS}"
    rf"(?![ \t]*[|,]|{_MARKER_CLOSE_CLASS})"
)

#: Label body, spelled once per regex so LINE and TRAILER cannot drift. LINE
#: stops at a newline; TRAILER spans them (``DOTALL``, as the old ``.*`` did).
#: The one body-shaped pattern NOT derived from these is
#: :data:`_OPTIONS_TAIL_PREFIX_RE`, which is a prefix closure and has to stay
#: looser -- see the reason there before "fixing" it to match.
#:
#: ReDoS: the four alternatives are mutually exclusive at every position. The
#: two bracket forms both begin at ``[`` (and both refuse a fresh ``[OPTIONS:``)
#: but cannot consume the same span -- the pair form's lookahead and the
#: continuation form's are each other's negation -- an unmatched ``[`` is left to
#: the bare-``[`` form, and the negated class excludes both ``[`` and every
#: closer. So there is never more than one way to consume a character, and each
#: lookahead is entered only at a bracket and bounded by the run it scans.

# CONTROL-TAG HTML COMMENTS — canonical grammar (single source of truth).
#
# Agent control tags ride in HTML comments, which the dashboard's markdown
# pipeline renders as nothing (rehype-raw emits comment nodes the react
# renderer skips). Three families exist in ``src/``:
#   * ``<!-- keep-visible -->``       — collapse-all exemption
#   * ``<!-- deliver:<route> -->``    — heartbeat routing
#   * ``<!-- plan_task_id:<id> -->``  — task-planner Apply-to-Tasks anchor
#
# ONE GRAMMAR, TAIL-ANCHORED + FENCE-GUARDED, case-insensitive, both
# recognizers (this regex and ``website/src/app-sdk/protocol/
# keepVisibleMarker.ts``): only standalone tag lines at the message tail are
# control tags, and a tail inside an UNTERMINATED fence is visible code (see
# ``_in_open_fence``). Message-tail producers: the prompt rule ("as its
# final line") and the task-planner appender (newline-prefixed). The
# heartbeat's ``deliver:`` tags are HEARTBEAT.md FILE-format suffixes on
# checklist lines, not message-tail emissions — echoed into a message body
# they are mid-body content, which the dashboard renders as nothing and this
# strip deliberately leaves alone. Position-independent stripping was tried
# and retired: rounds 5–8 each surfaced another quoted-code dialect it
# corrupted.
#
# Tag-line leading indent is ≤3 (CommonMark: 4+ spaces renders as an
# indented code block — visible content, never a control tag).
# ReDoS note: every quantifier is BOUNDED (whitespace ≤16, tag body ≤256 —
# generous for real emissions like ``<!-- deliver:dashboard -->``), so a
# failed match attempt does constant work and total matching stays linear
# even on adversarial repetition input (CodeQL py/polynomial-redos: an
# UNBOUNDED body with a failing ``-->`` suffix rescans per start position —
# quadratic). An unterminated ``<!--`` is NOT matched: swallowing to
# end-of-text on a missing ``-->`` silently deletes visible prose. A tag

#: Prefix closures of the marker grammars, for

#: a STILL-STREAMING marker only when every byte it holds so far could extend
#: into a complete marker. ``[OPTIONS`` must be followed by ``:`` and then a
#: PREFIX CLOSURE of :data:`OPTIONS_RE_TRAILER`'s body (DOTALL; ``[`` admitted
#: only when not opening a nested ``[OPTIONS:``) -- deliberately LOOSER than
#: that body, and the one place the "spelled once" rule in
#: :data:`_MARKER_BODY_LINE` does not apply. It has to be: a prefix of a legal
#: body need not itself be a legal body. ``[OPTIONS: A ]`` mid-stream holds a
#: closer that satisfies neither half of the closer rule YET, and becomes legal
#: the moment ``| B]`` arrives, so a probe spelled as the real body would call
#: that tail dead and publish the marker as raw text. Widening this to the
#: grammar is what ``test_options_marker_closers.py``'s
#: ``test_closer_inside_an_unfinished_label_is_still_unfinished`` forbids.
#: ``[STEERING`` follows the steer-ack
#: grammar (``messaging/driver.py``): whitespace gap, literal ``steer-``, a
#: nonempty hex/dash id, then an optional ``:`` summary -- spelled as nested
#: optionals so every cut point of the literal run is admitted, while a tail
#: that diverges from the grammar (``[OPTIONSDOC``, ``[STEERING

#: on purpose: these probe the exact sentinels the detach walk locates.

#: ``messaging.link.build_dm_session_key``), plus the ``unified:`` bucket that

#:
#: Deliberately excludes the non-channel namespaces that also contain a colon
#: (``dashboard:``, ``cron:``, ``hook:``, ``subagent:``, ``channel:``) — those
#: are surfaced by their own owners, not by the channel-session reconciler.
#:
#: NOTE: ``autonudge._CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIXES`` is a SEPARATE hand-kept copy. It is
#: often described as narrower; as of this writing it is not -- both hold the same
#: 11 namespaces. It answers a different question (does this key SHAPE belong to a
#: channel rather than a dashboard slot), which is why it lists namespaces nothing
#: can currently be delivered to. Deriving it from here would be sound and is
#: deliberately left out of the change that homed this roster; until then, do not
#: assume the two have diverged, and do not assume they are kept in step either.
#:
#: HOMED HERE, not in ``messaging.link``, because the roster has readers on both
#: sides of an import cycle. ``messaging.link`` is itself stdlib-only, but
#: importing anything from it executes ``messaging/__init__.py`` first, which
#: pulls in ``driver`` -> ``acp`` -> ``hooks``; a reader that ``hooks`` is already
#: mid-import for (``hooks`` -> ``webhooks`` -> ``validation``) then fails with a
#: partially-initialized ``hooks``. This module imports only ``os`` and ``re``, so
#: it can be read from anywhere. ``messaging.link`` re-exports both names, which

#: The channels an OWNER-DM may be inferred for -- ``send_message``'s channel
#: ``session`` values. A strict subset of :data:`CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES`, because
#: the two ask different questions and only one of them needs an owner.
#:
#: ``channel_type`` names a conversation: the one the calling session already
#: belongs to, or an explicit ``target_id`` the agent supplies. Neither infers a
#: recipient. A channel ``session`` DOES infer one, from
#: ``configured_targets()`` via ``_owner_dm_target``, whose safety claim is that
#: the agent can only reach somebody the USER configured.
#:
#: ``weixin`` and ``wecom`` are excluded because that claim is false on both. Each
#: folds identities LEARNED from inbound traffic into ``configured_targets()`` --
#: Weixin's ``_known_users`` (``_allowed | _known_users``) and WeCom's
#: ``_warm_chats``, which under ``wecom.allow_all_users`` become the list outright
#: ("there is no configured list to draw on, so the warm peers ARE the list"). So a
#: peer who messaged the bot once can be the single available direct target, which
#: is exactly what ``_owner_dm_target`` reads as "the owner". Nothing downstream
#: catches it: both transports' ``may_send_to`` returns True unconditionally under
#: their open policy (Weixin's promise to consult ``_allowed`` alone holds only on
#: its ``allowlist`` branch), and ``resolve_configured_target`` accepts the learned
#: set too. So private agent output would reach an arbitrary peer, not the operator.
#:
#: The other seven transports draw ``configured_targets()`` from configured state
#: alone; ``test_no_owner_dm_channel_advertises_learned_identities`` is the ratchet
#: that keeps this subtraction honest rather than hand-kept, so a transport that
#: starts mixing learned identities in fails the gate instead of silently becoming
#: an owner-DM target.
#:
#: This is a per-channel CAPABILITY gap, not drift: the exclusion is derived from
#: the send roster and carries its reason, the way ``slack`` and ``unified`` do. A
#: channel graduates by distinguishing configured recipients from learned peers in
#: ``configured_targets()`` -- at which point deleting it from this subtraction is
#: the whole change.
