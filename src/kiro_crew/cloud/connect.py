"""Connect to a launched KiroCrew instance — SSM tunnel + token + open browser.

The instance's gateway is bound to loopback (never public). To reach it we:

1. Open an SSM port-forward from a local port to the remote dashboard port.
2. Mint a short-lived dashboard token on the instance (``kirocrew token``) over
   SSM and parse the ``localhost`` URL it prints.
3. Open ``http://localhost:<local>/?token=...`` in the browser.

We also (optionally) register the instance in the existing **Instances** registry
using the **native SSM transport** (``connection_method="ssm"`` with the EC2
instance id as ``ssm_target``), so the dashboard's ``/instances`` page can
auto-tunnel + token-refresh + self-heal it with no SSH key, no inbound port, and
no hand-edited ``~/.ssh/config`` — only IAM + the SSM agent. Removing the box
(``cloud destroy``) also removes that registration.

    cloud launch, per the launch job store — i.e. it is a *correlated* instance,

    Protects a correlated instance's addressing fields
    (``connection_method``/``ssm_target``/``aws_profile``/``aws_region``) from
    being rewritten via the generic ``PATCH /api/instances/{id}`` endpoint:
    doing so would leave Stop/Start/Delete unable to resolve the real EC2 stack,
    which then keeps running and billing with no dashboard path to reach it.

    Best-effort ONLY for the "cloud feature not installed" case: an
    ``ImportError`` on the launch job module means nothing could ever have
    been launched, so returning False (not correlated) is safe. Every OTHER
    failure propagates, so the caller
    (``handlers_instances._is_correlated_cloud_instance`` / the PATCH handler)

    "not correlated" would let an I/O blip unlock a launched instance's
    addressing fields for PATCH to rewrite, which is exactly the stranding
    this function exists to prevent.

    That is why this reads the job files directly instead of calling
    ``LaunchJobStore.list()``. ``list()`` is built for DISPLAY, where dropping
    one damaged record beats showing nothing: it defers to ``get()``, which
    logs and returns ``None`` for a file it cannot read or parse, and then
    omits that job. Borrowing it here would invert the guarantee above — one
    unreadable job file, including the one for the instance being edited,
    would read as "no such launch job" and unlock the fields. A vanished file
    is the single benign case (a concurrent ``cloud destroy`` removing a job
