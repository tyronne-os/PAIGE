"""EC2 lifecycle for the cloud launcher — provision / status / stop / start / destroy.

Every AWS interaction goes through :mod:`kiro_crew.cloud.aws` (the ``run_aws``
chokepoint). Provisioning is a **CloudFormation** stack (``kirocrew-ec2.yaml``):
one atomic, rollback-safe deploy; ``destroy`` is a single ``delete-stack`` that
removes *every* resource the launch created (instance, role, instance profile,
security group, EBS volume). Nothing is left behind — this is the clean
uninstall/remove-from-AWS path.

Discovery is **stateless-by-tag** (like deploy-web): every resource carries
``kirocrew:managed=true`` + ``kirocrew:instance=<tag>``, and the stack itself is
named deterministically, so ``status``/``stop``/``start``/``destroy`` find the
right stack without relying on a local cache that could drift.
