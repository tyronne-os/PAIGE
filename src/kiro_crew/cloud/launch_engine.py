"""The real :class:`~kiro_crew.cloud.launch_job.LaunchEngine` — binds the launch
job's abstract steps to the tested ``cloud/`` engine functions.

Kept separate from the HTTP handlers so it can be unit tested by monkeypatching
the ``cloud`` modules, with no aiohttp and no live AWS. It adds **no** new AWS
logic: ``preflight`` reuses ``iam.reachability_check``, ``provision`` reuses
``ec2.deploy``, sign-in reuses ``login.*``, and ``register`` reuses
``connect.register_instance`` — the same calls the CLI wizard already makes.
