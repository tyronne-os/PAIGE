"""Which provider a session is configured to run on.

This is the ``agent.provider`` axis: the config key an operator sets, whose
value reaches roughly a dozen branches that need to know "am I on Claude Code".
Spelling the value inline in each branch makes the provider-specific logic
impossible to find by grep and impossible to change in one place, so it is
consolidated here.

Four different things are spelled ``"claude_code"`` in this codebase and only
the FIRST is this module's business. Consolidating the others into this one
would be wrong, so they are named here to keep the next reader from trying:

1. **This axis** -- the ``agent.provider`` config value, and the question
   "is the configured provider Claude Code". Owned here.

2. **The session-map provider label** -- ``PROVIDER_LABEL_CLAUDE`` in
   :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.types`. Same string, different job: it indexes resume
   compatibility, session-map persistence, and session-file cleanup routing.
   It has its own constant already; use that one when writing a session map.

3. **A model-registry index key** -- inside :mod:`kiro_crew.model_registry`,
   ``"claude_code"`` names a registry namespace, NOT a provider check. The
   module says so where it matters: *"Named for the registry key, NOT because
   windows are claude_code-only."* A model's context window is a property of
   the model, not of the provider serving it. Do not route those through the
   predicate below -- it would assert a provider identity the code is
   explicitly not testing.

4. **An onboarding import-source id** -- in :mod:`kiro_crew.onboarding_import`,
   ``"claude_code"`` identifies the Claude Code desktop app whose settings are
   being imported (``~/.claude``, ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR``). It describes a
   foreign config tree on disk and is unrelated to what this process runs on.

(1) and (2) hold equal values today and are pinned equal by a test rather than
by an import, so a future divergence fails loudly instead of silently coupling
config vocabulary to session-map vocabulary.

Deliberately dependency-free: only stdlib, no ``kiro_crew`` imports, so this
module can never be the module that closes an import cycle.

Note what that does NOT buy. Importing ``kiro_crew.agent_sdk.provider_identity``
executes the parent package's ``__init__``, which loads ``backend_install`` and
``agent_sdk.drivers.acp`` -- naming the submodule does not skip them. What keeps
that cheap is that the chain is import-light rather than absent: ``acp_backends``
is stdlib-only, and ``drivers.acp`` defers every ``kiro_crew.acp`` import into a
function body, so ``kiro_crew.acp`` itself stays unloaded. That last property is
pinned by ``test_importing_this_module_does_not_load_the_acp_package``.
