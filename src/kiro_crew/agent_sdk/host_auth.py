"""How each agent backend signs in, declared once per harness.

Before this module every auth fact about a harness was an edit to a shared table
or an ``if`` chain in a host module: the credential floor spelled the token leaf,
the sandbox mask spelled the one leaf to leave readable, a membership set spelled
whether a host logout may retire a running child, and the panel spelled the
sign-in advice in thirteen locale files. Nothing in the tree was a per-harness
auth object, so a harness that brought its own sign-in was onboarded by touching
twenty-four files -- and the harness that shipped selectable first touched none
of them, which is how a live agent-readable OAuth token sat off the floor while
that harness was already selectable.

One declaration per harness, and the host layers PROJECT from it:

============================================  ================================
consumer                                      projection it reads
============================================  ================================
``security.paths`` credential floor           :func:`credential_leaves`,
                                              :func:`override_anchored_leaves`,
                                              :func:`home_override_env_vars`
``agent_sdk.tool_gate`` own-leaf exclusion    :data:`AGENT_AUTH_DECLARATIONS`
``agent_sdk.backends`` logout-recycle set     :func:`backends_retired_by_host_logout`
``acp`` auth-required message                 :func:`signed_out_message`
``cli_doctor`` sign-in row                    :func:`declaration_for`
``GET /api/acp-backends`` auth object         :func:`declaration_for`
============================================  ================================

The split is the security property, not a tidiness one. A driver declares WHAT IT
STORES; the host decides what is fenced. A driver that could edit the mask could
exclude its way out of it, so no field here names a path to leave open in general
-- ``adapter_own_leaves`` may only name a leaf this same declaration already put
ON the floor, and :meth:`AgentAuthDeclaration.__post_init__` refuses a
declaration that tries otherwise.

Why this module is stdlib-only
------------------------------
``security.paths`` reads this table while building the credential floor, and it
is imported very early -- which is precisely why it reads
:mod:`kiro_crew.identity_stores`, a stdlib-only leaf, rather than anything
heavier. This table has to sit on the same footing or the floor cannot read it
without closing an import cycle. So the only non-stdlib import here is
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`, itself stdlib-only, for the backend ids.
``test/test_agent_sdk_host_auth.py`` pins that: it walks this module's own
module-scope imports against an allowlist AND spawns a cold interpreter to
assert importing it pulls in no third-party module and none of
``kiro_crew.security``, ``kiro_crew.acp``, ``kiro_crew.config`` or
``kiro_crew.sandbox``.

Interactive login is the OPTIONAL half
--------------------------------------
A harness that brings its own sign-in -- Codex, Claude Code -- needs no in-product
login flow, and :class:`AgentInteractiveLogin` is how that absence stays visible.
It is a ``runtime_checkable`` protocol tested with ``isinstance``, never a
boolean field, so a driver that does not implement it is a shape the type system
can see rather than one that answers a flag and then no-ops.

#: is a regression whether or not the fact behind it is right, so the label lives
