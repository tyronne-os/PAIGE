"""The on-disk appearance-pack library: list, read, save, delete.

One store class serves every library, because a library is just a data directory:
the dashboard roots one at ``<data home>/appearance-library/`` for the packs a crew
wears, and Crew Companion roots its own at its app data directory. They share the
format and this reader, and nothing else — neither can see the other's packs.

The pack SHAPE is what ``appearanceTypes.ts`` defines — a manifest plus animation
files — so a pack a user already made remains loadable, and one exported from
either library imports into the other unchanged.

Three properties this has to keep:

* **A pack the user made is precious.** Custom art is unrecoverable if lost, so writes
  go through a temp file and a rename, and a delete only ever touches a custom pack's
  own directory.
* **A malformed pack must not take the gateway down.** A pack is third-party content,
  possibly hand-edited. Anything unreadable is skipped with a warning and the others
  still load, rather than one bad manifest emptying the library.
* **The built-in ghost is not a file.** Its art ships inside the frontend bundle, so it
  is registered from code, cannot be deleted or renamed, and is always present even
  when the custom directory is empty.
