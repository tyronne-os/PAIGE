"""Single-writer guard for a ``KIROCREW_HOME``.

Two ``kirocrew gateway`` processes bound to the same home each open the same
``sessions/*.jsonl`` as ``ConversationLog`` writers. The steady-save fast path
assumes a single writer per file, so the stale process's shutdown flush rolls
back newer on-disk content -- the dual-writer clobber that loses transcripts.

This module enforces the single-writer invariant at the source: the gateway
acquires an exclusive advisory ``flock`` on ``<home>/gateway.lock`` at startup
and holds it for the process lifetime. A second gateway on the same home is
refused.

What ``flock`` does and does not guarantee
-----------------------------------------
``flock`` belongs to the open file *description*, so it is immune to a hazard
that would otherwise be fatal here: an unrelated ``open()`` + ``close()`` of the
lock path elsewhere in this process cannot release it. That matters because the
gateway serves authenticated file reads over HTTP, and the lock file is inside
the home those reads can reach. A POSIX record lock (``fcntl.lockf``) is keyed by
(process, inode) instead, so one such read would silently drop this guard and let
a second gateway start -- exactly the corruption this module exists to prevent.
``flock`` is chosen deliberately for that reason.

The cost of that choice is the other half of the same property. ``fork()`` shares
one description between parent and child, so a forked child that inherits this fd
keeps the lock alive after the parent dies. A child that wedges before ``exec``
therefore pins the home: every later start is refused, and the pid recorded in
the file names a process that no longer exists. This occurs when ``preexec_fn``
forces a plain ``fork()`` of the multi-threaded gateway in
:mod:`kiro_crew.kiro_prerequisite`.

The remedy is to stop creating such children, not to weaken this guard;
``_run_process`` therefore does not use ``preexec_fn``. What this
module owes the operator meanwhile is an honest refusal: it resolves the process
that ACTUALLY holds the lock from ``/proc/*/fd`` rather than quoting the pid in
the file, reports what that process looks like, and names the reclaim command
when the evidence points at an inherited fd. It never kills anything itself.

Isolated homes (``--test-mode``/``--seed`` with a distinct ``KIROCREW_HOME``)
resolve to a different lock file and are unaffected.
