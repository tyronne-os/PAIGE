"""Deterministic recall harness for the Knowledge Library's ``HybridRetriever``.

This is T0 of the Knowledge Library roadmap: the measurement substrate every
retrieval-quality change (freshness weighting, a reranker, tool-description
rewrites) is judged against. It answers one question exactly -- *given a labeled
set of ``(query -> answering doc)`` pairs, does the KB surface the right doc,
ranked high?* -- and it answers it the same way on every run, so a delta between
two commits is attributable to the code change rather than to sampling.

It is deliberately **separate** from ``bench retrieval`` (``run.py``): that harness
measures the conversational *memory* layer (``VectorMemoryStore`` over LoCoMo /
LongMemEval, turn/session gold). This one measures the *Knowledge Library* --
``HybridRetriever.search`` over a real :class:`KnowledgeStore`, with a chunk-shaped
golden set whose gold labels are document ids.

Why a synthetic golden set. No public retrieval benchmark cleanly models "a later
document supersedes an earlier one", which is exactly what the KB's
correction/contradiction/retraction classes are about. The v1 set is hand-authored,
so lexical overlap can flatter retrieval (especially with the toy embedder) and its
1–2 queries per class are directional rather than statistically stable; a v2 can
graft the answerable classes onto LongMemEval later without changing this scorer.

The default embedder is the deterministic :func:`toy_embed_fn` -- a hashed
bag-of-words stand-in that makes the harness runnable and testable on a host whose
vendored llama.cpp payload cannot load, and makes a test assertion about ranking
stable across processes. It measures term overlap, **not** semantic recall, so a
number produced with it is a plumbing check, not a reportable benchmark result;
the real ``InProcessEmbedder`` is used only when explicitly requested and resident.
