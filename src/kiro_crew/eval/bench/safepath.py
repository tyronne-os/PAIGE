"""One filesystem guard for every caller-influenced path in the benchmark harness.

Why a shared helper rather than a check at each call site: the first two rounds of
review on this code found the same class of hole twice, in mirror image. Round one
gated the report *read* (``bench compare <path>``); round two found the report
*write* (``--out-dir`` + ``--stem``) still ungated, which is strictly worse — a read
discloses, a write destroys. Fixing that one site would have left three more:
``--out-dir``'s ``mkdir``, and the corpus cache root, which ``KIROCREW_BENCH_CACHE``
can point anywhere. Point-wise patching is how the second hole survived the first
fix, so the guard lives in one place and every argv- or env-influenced path calls it.

The threat model is the same one that justifies the read gate. These values arrive
from argv and the environment, and in this product neither is necessarily set by the
human who owns the machine: an agent can run any CLI command. So

    kirocrew bench retrieval --out-dir ~/.kiro/crew --stem security_policy

is a reachable invocation that would overwrite a governance policy file with a
benchmark report. Nothing about the benchmark needs to write there, so it is refused
rather than made careful.

Write protection is deliberately stricter than read protection. ``is_sensitive_path``
answers "is this path inside a protected location"; for a directory that is about to
receive files, the question is also "does a protected location lie *under* it", which
is what ``path_contains_sensitive`` answers. A ``--out-dir`` of ``~`` is not itself
sensitive, but writing a tree there is not something this command should do.

    is atomic, so a name that already holds a file, a symlink, a hardlink alias or a
    directory fails with ``EEXIST`` and is refused rather than written through. That is
    what makes this safe where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist — see below — and it is
    also why nothing here truncates: there is never anything to truncate.

    A caller that needs to REPLACE an existing file wants
    :func:`write_text_atomic_nofollow`, which publishes by rename. This one is for
    the temporary files a rename publishes from, and for artifacts written once.

    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` (where it exists) fails with ``ELOOP`` when the final component is
    a link, which makes the refusal specific rather than a bare ``EEXIST``.

    Returns a raw fd; wrap it with :func:`os.fdopen`. Mode is 0o600 because a corpus
    cache file has no reason to be group- or world-readable.

    Note which path is opened: the guard resolves in order to answer "does this name
    mean somewhere protected", but the ``open`` must use the path **as given**, not the
    resolved one. Opening the resolved path makes ``O_NOFOLLOW`` a no-op -- resolution
    has already followed the link, so the flag inspects the target's final component
    instead of the link, and the write lands on the redirect exactly as if there were
    no flag at all. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` only covers the final component; ancestor
    directories are covered by guarding the containing root.

    **Windows has no ``O_NOFOLLOW``.** ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` returns 0
    there, so the flag contributes nothing and ``O_EXCL`` carries the protection
    instead. An earlier version relied on an ``is_symlink()`` pre-check and then
    opened the name for writing, which refused a link that was already there and
    followed one planted between the check and the open -- a window a reviewer was
    right to call a defect rather than a documented limit. Exclusive creation has no
    such window on any platform, because there is no moment at which an existing name
    is opened at all. The ``is_symlink()`` check is kept only so the refusal says
    "this is a symbolic link" instead of "something exists here".

    A ctypes ``CreateFileW`` with ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` is not worth
    considering here: it would buy the same property exclusive creation already has,
    at the price of security code that cannot be exercised on the machine this

    (2) exists because a descriptor cannot be held here. A link in the chain is the
    component an attacker retargets, so where the write cannot be pinned to an inode,
    the presence of that component is refused instead. The cost is honest: an
    ``--out-dir`` reached through a junction is rejected on Windows and the message
    says so. The alternative -- refusing every write on the platform, which is what a

    when a caller ``stat``s a path and later asks this helper to open it.

    Non-regular files are always refused. ``O_NONBLOCK`` keeps opening a FIFO from
    hanging before the descriptor can be classified; it is inert for regular files.
    When ``max_bytes`` is set, the helper checks the descriptor's current size AND
    reads at most ``max_bytes + 1``. The second check is load-bearing: a regular file
    can grow after ``fstat``, and trusting only ``st_size`` would recreate an
    unbounded-read window.

    Opening the resolved path (not the path as given) preserves the documented read
    asymmetry: a symlink to an ordinary file remains readable. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` still
