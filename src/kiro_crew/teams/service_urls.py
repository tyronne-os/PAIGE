"""Durable Teams routing references (conversation id -> serviceUrl).

The Bot Framework does not let a bot look up where to reach a conversation: the
``serviceUrl`` arrives on an inbound activity and the bot is expected to remember
it. A purely in-memory map therefore loses every proactive destination on restart
-- a cron result, a subagent-completion notice, or a dashboard mirror leg has
nowhere to send until the user happens to speak first, and the send fails with a
"missing service_url" that reads like a bug rather than lost state.

The store is deliberately small and boring:

* **Not on the boot path.** Loading is lazy and off-loop; nothing reads this file
  while the gateway is starting (``AUTOSDE`` forbids new boot-path work, and the
  cost here scales with the number of conversations ever seen).
* **Failure is never fatal.** An unreadable or unwritable store degrades to the
  in-memory map -- the same behavior as having no store at all -- because losing
  a routing hint must not stop message delivery.
* **Fenced from the agent, directory and all.** The file maps allow-listed identities
  to the conversations they are reachable at, and ``teams/transport.py`` resolves an
  explicit ``user:<upn>`` send target through that map -- so a writable copy is a way to
  have somebody's cron result delivered to somebody else. It therefore lives in its own
  ``routing/`` directory under the data home, which ``security`` registers as a keystone
  leaf; see :data:`STORE_DIRNAME` for why the directory and not the file.
* **Owner-only on disk.** A serviceUrl is not itself a secret (it is a
  Microsoft-operated host, already visible in the inbound activity and in the
  outbound request URL), but the file also maps allow-listed operator UPNs to the
  conversations they use, which is personal data with no reason to be
  world-readable.
* **Bounded on BOTH sides of the boundary.** Eviction keeps a live gateway from
  growing the file forever, and the load path caps what it will adopt -- a file
  that arrived oversize (hand-edited, merged, or written by a build with a larger
  cap) must not turn the first eviction into an O(n^2) scan on the event loop.
