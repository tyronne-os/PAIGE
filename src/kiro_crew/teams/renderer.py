"""Layer 2b -- Microsoft Teams ``Renderer``.

Maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by the base
:class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Bot Framework REST calls:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- posts a ``typing`` activity for immediate feedback.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- lazily opens ONE progress message and edits it in place as
  tools run, so a long agentic turn is not silent. Teams supports updating a
  bot's own activity (``PUT .../activities/{id}``), which is what makes this
  possible here where WeCom and Weixin -- whose reply is bound to the inbound
  request -- cannot have it.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- buffered (no typewriter streaming: Teams' native token
  streaming is 1 req/s and capped at two minutes, which a long turn exceeds).
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- posts the Approve / Trust session / Deny Adaptive Card
  and arms its nonce on the decider, so a click resolves the awaiting prompt and
  a card from a previous run cannot.
* ``on_done`` -- delivers the final answer, reusing the progress message for the
  first chunk so no "Working…" bubble is stranded above the reply, then any local
  image the reply referenced, then any ``[OPTIONS:]`` choices as a chip card.

Splitting goes through the shared fence-safe ``split_markdown_safe`` rather than
blind fixed-width slicing, so a long reply cannot be cut through the middle of a
code fence. Text is re-scanned in its DISPLAY form before delivery, because
removing or rendering markup can reassemble a credential the driver's scan saw
as broken.

``on_done`` is also the single OUTBOUND FILE seal: an agent that writes
``![chart](/tmp/chart.png)`` gets the picture in the conversation instead of a
filesystem path. The reference scanning, the security floor and the byte budgets
belong to ``messaging/outbound_files.py``; this renderer supplies only Teams'
half -- one inline ``data:`` URI attachment per image, the narrower format
allow-list, and a visible refusal for anything that cannot go that way. Teams does
not stream, so there are no live frames that could flash the markup before the
seal replaces it.

Dependency direction is ``teams -> messaging`` (allowed).
