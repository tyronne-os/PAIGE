"""Teams' half of session resume: an Adaptive Card picker over the shared core.

Every decision — which sessions are offerable, the picker nonce/TTL/owner scoping, the
binding-conflict rules, and the inbound routing + settlement state machine — lives in
:mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.session_resume`, shared with Discord. This module is only what
is Teams-shaped:

* the picker is an Adaptive Card whose ``Action.Submit`` returns as an ordinary
  ``message`` activity (the same mechanism tool approval and ``[OPTIONS:]`` chips use,
  so it needs no ``invoke`` handler the fast-ack ingress has no room for);
* Teams' own display redaction, and its ``/sessions`` / ``/unlink`` spellings;
* the conversation address, bound at construction so no id type reaches the core.

**Owner-only, and stricter than Discord's rule for a reason.** Discord requires exactly
one configured user id. Teams' allow-list routinely holds several people, and a
dashboard session is the OPERATOR's whole working transcript — so this is gated on the
allow-list having exactly one entry too. With more than one, listing is refused rather
than letting any allow-listed member enumerate and attach to the operator's chats.
