"""Adaptive Cards: the interactive surface Teams actually has.

Teams renders no Block Kit and no message components, but it does render
Adaptive Cards, and an ``Action.Submit`` on one comes back as an ORDINARY
``message`` activity whose ``value`` holds the button's data payload. That is
what makes tool approval and ``[OPTIONS:]`` chips reachable here.

``Action.Submit`` is deliberate, and ``Action.Execute`` is deliberately NOT used:
a universal action arrives as an ``invoke`` activity that must be answered with a
synchronous ``{statusCode, type, value}`` body, which is incompatible with the
fast-ack-then-background-turn shape the Connector's ~15s inbound timeout forces.
A submit needs no synchronous answer, so the existing ingress works unchanged.

Two safety properties live here:

* **A stale button fails closed.** ACP request ids restart at 1 for every
  provider/gateway process, so a card left in a Teams chat from a previous run
  can carry a request id that is live again for a DIFFERENT tool. Every prompt
  therefore mints a random nonce, and a submit whose nonce does not match the
  pending prompt is refused rather than treated as an answer to it.
* **The card carries no authority.** The payload is data a client sends, so it is
  only ever a LOOKUP key into state this process already holds. Nothing about the
  decision — which tool, which session, whether it is still pending — is read out
  of the submit.

Card version is pinned to 1.4: Teams supports up to 1.6, but 1.4 is the floor
every currently-supported Teams client renders, and nothing here needs a later
feature.
