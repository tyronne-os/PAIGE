"""Microsoft Teams / Bot Framework client transport layer.

Inbound: the Bot Framework POSTs Activity payloads to a single HTTPS webhook
route (registered on the gateway's aiohttp app). Each request carries an
``Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`` that MUST be validated (signature via the Bot
Framework JWKS, issuer in the documented set, audience == the bot's App ID,
expiry) before the activity is processed. The handler fast-acks with HTTP 200
and runs the agent turn in a background task so a long turn never times out the
inbound POST.

Outbound: plain REST -- ``POST {serviceUrl}/v3/conversations/{id}/activities``
authenticated with an app-credential (client-credentials) bearer token that is
cached and refreshed before expiry. A ``typing`` activity is posted at turn
start for immediate feedback.

No Bot Framework SDK dependency -- pure ``aiohttp`` for HTTP plus ``PyJWT`` for
inbound token verification (an optional ``kirocrew[teams]`` extra). This keeps
the module lightweight, OSS-clean, and easy to audit.
