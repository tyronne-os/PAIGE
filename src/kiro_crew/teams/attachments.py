"""Teams-specific file policy for both directions.

Teams owns only what is genuinely Teams-shaped. Everything that is identical for
every channel stays in the neutral modules:

* inbound classification, size limits, image-signature validation, text/document
  extraction, redaction, rejection wording, transcription and temp-file
  ownership -> :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.attachments`
* outbound reference scanning, the security floor, the raster sniff and the
  per-message budgets -> :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.outbound_files`

What is Teams-shaped, and therefore lives here:

**Inbound: two attachment kinds with OPPOSITE auth.** A file the user uploads in
a personal chat arrives as ``application/vnd.microsoft.teams.file.download.info``
whose ``content.downloadUrl`` Microsoft documents as something the reader "can
issue an HTTP GET directly from" -- it carries its own capability and MUST be
fetched with a plain GET, because attaching the bot's Connector bearer token to a
host we do not control would hand a credential-equivalent secret to whoever that
host belongs to. An inline image instead arrives with a ``contentUrl`` on a
Microsoft-operated host, for which the guidance is contradictory: one revision
says the SDK handles authentication, the previous one and the shipped sample
attach the bot token. The two cases are one boolean apart and getting it backwards
is a credential leak in one direction and a broken feature in the other, so the
mapping is explicit per content type, the transport never guesses, and the client
decides on the host (see ``client.download_inbound_file``).

Teams also echoes the message body itself as a ``text/html`` (or ``text/plain``)
attachment on ordinary rich-text messages. Those are not files and are skipped,
because ingesting them would inject the same words twice into every prompt.

**Outbound: an inline image needs no hosting and no consent round trip.** An
``Attachment`` whose ``contentUrl`` is a ``data:image/...;base64,`` URI renders
in the conversation directly, which is the whole common case -- an agent-produced
chart. Anything that is NOT one of :data:`TEAMS_INLINE_IMAGE_MIMES` is refused
with a visible reason rather than dropped; sending a non-image file would need
the ``FileConsentCard`` round trip, which requires handling an ``invoke``
activity that this channel's fast-ack ingress does not do.
