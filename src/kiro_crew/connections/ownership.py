"""The Disconnect ownership oracle: who owns an MCP entry and its grant.

Relocated verbatim from ``kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.connections`` so the
destructive-decision logic — the spec census, the entry/grant identity
judgement, and the single-lock purge-and-revoke transaction — is owned and
evolved apart from the HTTP layer. The handler keeps the route-facing concerns
(auth, body parsing, mint teardown, reading the open project directories off
dashboard slot state, audit, response shape) and calls
:func:`remove_provider_entry` with that snapshot, so nothing in this module
touches dashboard state.

The public names are deliberately NOT re-exported from
``kiro_crew.connections.__init__``: a package-level re-export would put this
module on the import path of every ``from kiro_crew.connections import …``,
and the census helpers are collaborators of one destructive endpoint, not
package API. Import them from this module directly.

The docstrings and comments below carry the safety reasoning that shaped this
code across the disconnect review rounds; they moved with it unchanged. The
behavior is pinned by ``test/test_connections_disconnect.py``: the census
helpers directly, the judge and transaction through the disconnect endpoint.

) -> DisconnectScope:
    """Decide what this Disconnect owns and act on it, all under ONE lock.

    Three destructive acts share one judgement, so they share one read and one
    lock hold: which scopes' ``slug`` entry is actually this provider's, whether
    any OTHER entry shares the provider's grant ARTIFACTS, and -- only if nothing
    does -- unlinking the artifacts. Splitting them is what produced three
    separate data-loss paths:

    * a census that missed custom agent configs revoked a grant an agent outside
      Kiro Crew was authorized by (see :func:`agent_spec_sources`);
    * a purge that removed the name from EVERY scope while ownership was judged
      from the merged winner deleted a same-named entry in another scope that
      pointed somewhere else -- so the purge now names the scopes it matched
      (``_purge_server_config(scopes=...)``) and no other scope is touched;
    * a revoke that ran after the lock released deleted the grant of an entry
      added in between. Holding the MCP lock across the unlinks is the accepted
      cost of closing that: a config writer waits as long as two ``unlink`` calls
      against the user's home take, which is the same exposure every other writer
      under this lock already has.

    The two questions use DIFFERENT identity functions, because they protect
    different things. Entry identity is ``normalized_endpoint`` on name AND url --
    the pair the card matches on and the rule :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.l1_smoke`
    keeps -- so a user's same-named server at another endpoint is never purged.
    Grant identity is ``grant_key`` equality, because the artifacts being protected
    are FILES NAMED BY ``grant_key``, and the two functions disagree in both
    directions: ``normalized_endpoint`` keeps the query string and strips a
    trailing slash, ``grant_key`` drops the query and keeps the path verbatim. A
    ``?workspace=`` variant shares our artifact pair but is a different endpoint;
    a trailing-slash variant is the same endpoint but a different artifact pair.
    Testing the credential with the endpoint comparator would delete a shared
    grant in the first case and strand a live one (reported as a deliberate keep)
    in the second.

    The sweep reads the RAW specs, not the probe view: ``list_servers`` drops
    disabled entries outside the Kiro Crew scope, and a user's switched-off server
    still owns its grant -- deleting it because its entry is disabled would force a
    fresh consent the moment they re-enable it. The probe view is unioned in so a
    row this census cannot parse still counts.

    FAIL CLOSED, asymmetrically, because the two acts need opposite evidence. The
    revoke needs the ABSENCE of a sharer, which an unreadable source can hide, so
    one unreadable source keeps the grant. The purge acts only on POSITIVE
    evidence -- a scope whose entry it read and matched -- so an unreadable scope
    simply is not purged, and refusing the whole request would leave the user
    unable to disconnect at all because of a file that has nothing to do with this
    provider.

    Reuses the apply path's own config-side uninstall so a Disconnect and an
    ``uninstall`` apply remove byte-identical config rather than drifting into two
    definitions of "removed". A failed agent-config rebuild is logged, not raised:
    the config write has already landed by then, so failing the request would report
    a Disconnect that did not happen.

    ``project_dirs`` is REQUIRED rather than defaulted: the census reads it to
    reach ``<project>/.kiro/agents``, and a default of "no projects" on the one
    destructive caller would let a forgotten argument narrow the census back to
    the gap this parameter exists to close, silently and only for users who have
    a project-local spec.

    One non-destructive act follows, after the lock: the warm pool is asked to
    re-arm this provider's premint, because an invalidated grant is what makes it
    warmable again and nothing else would ask. It is scheduled, never awaited --
    see :func:`kiro_crew.connections.warm.rearm_invalidated_provider` -- and only
    when NO owned artifact survived, because a half-removed pair reads as a
    definitive absence and would have the pool initiate consent over residue.

        THREE-valued, because two implementations compute this key. kiro-cli
        derives the artifact pair with the WHATWG url parser, which

        dot-segments and backslashes, and percent-encodes non-ASCII paths --
        transformations ``urlsplit`` does not perform. Hashing such a URL here

        ``%6dcp.notion.com`` and ``/a/../mcp`` both name the

        Outside that set the answer is ``_UNPROVABLE`` and the caller fails
        closed: the grant is kept and the census reported incomplete, because
        deleting on an unprovable comparison is how a live consent dies.

        Within the provable set, ``None`` still means SKIP, on two premises that
        stay sound: unparseable junk (the round-3/4 shapes) can hold no pair
        under either parser, and a provable-charset host that Python's IDNA
        refuses (empty or >63-char label) is serialized verbatim by kiro-cli and
