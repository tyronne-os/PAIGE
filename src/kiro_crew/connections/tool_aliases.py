"""Resolve MCP tool-name collisions into kiro-cli ``toolAliases`` declarations.

Two exposed MCP servers may expose the SAME tool name -- Linear and Vercel both
ship ``list_projects``, ``get_project`` and ``list_teams``; Linear, GitHub and
GitLab all ship ``list_issues``. kiro-cli addresses a tool by bare name, so the
second mount SHADOWS the first: one provider's tool becomes unreachable and the
agent silently calls the other provider's. ``toolAliases`` is kiro-cli's remedy
(``{"@server/tool": "new_name"}``); this module decides what goes in it.

GOVERNING DECISION TABLE
========================
Three axes decide every case. Enumerated in full because point-fixes to one axis
kept contradicting another: EXPOSURE (what ``tools`` actually mounts) x IDENTITY
(is this really that provider) x DECLARATION LIFECYCLE (has the registry moved
since the spec was last written).

``renamed`` on the lifecycle axis means the registry renamed a TOOL KEY. An
alias-VALUE rename is unreachable by construction: every alias is pinned to
``<slug>_<tool>`` (see :func:`derived_alias`), so the registry validator rejects
any other spelling.

Outcomes: ``ALIAS`` = rename the colliding exposed tools; ``NONE`` = emit nothing
for this provider; ``STRIP`` = an already-generated ref is removed. STRIP is
orthogonal to ALIAS/NONE and applies on every row, because the generated domain
is recomputed from the registry rather than read back off the spec. WHICH pairs
STRIP may touch is not decided here: it is decided by the persisted record of
what the last pass emitted (:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.alias_record`), so every
STRIP below is read as "strip it IF the record claims it".

IDENTITY = registry-URL-matched (the only identity that can produce an alias)

  #   EXPOSURE            LIFECYCLE   OUTCOME
  1   @slug               current     ALIAS: all declared sources exposed; rename
                                      each name another provider also EXPOSES
  2   @slug               renamed     ALIAS(new) + STRIP(old): the superseded pair
                                      was recorded, so it goes
  3   @slug               removed     NONE + STRIP(old): nothing left to declare
  4   @slug/tool          current     ALIAS only if that ONE tool is also exposed
                                      by another provider -- per-tool exposure is
                                      not provider-wide exposure
  5   @slug/tool          renamed     ALIAS(new) for that tool only + STRIP(old)
  6   @slug/tool          removed     NONE: the ref names a tool the registry no
                                      longer declares, so it is not a source
  7   *                   current     as row 1 for every mounted provider
  8   *                   renamed     as row 2
  9   *                   removed     as row 3
  10  @slug/*             current     as row 1 -- see WILDCARD FAIL-SAFE below
  11  @slug/*             renamed     as row 2
  12  @slug/*             removed     as row 3
  13  allowedTools-only   current     NONE: ``allowedTools`` auto-approves, it
                                      does not MOUNT. A ref absent from the
                                      closed ``tools`` allowlist exposes no tool,
                                      so it cannot collide with anything.
  14  allowedTools-only   renamed     NONE + STRIP(old)
  15  allowedTools-only   removed     NONE + STRIP(old)
  16  absent              current     NONE: not mounted
  17  absent              renamed     NONE + STRIP(old)
  18  absent              removed     NONE + STRIP(old)

IDENTITY = URL-mismatched (rows 19-36)
IDENTITY = custom-server-carrying-a-registry-name (rows 37-54)

  Both collapse to NONE for all 6 exposures x 3 lifecycles, and STRIP still
  applies. Identity is gated BEFORE exposure is consulted, so neither of the
  other two axes can discriminate: a server that is not the provider has no
  claim on that provider's declarations whatever ``tools`` says about it. One
  behaviour is NOT collapsed -- such a server's per-tool refs still RESERVE
  their tool names against generated destinations (see DESTINATION RESERVATION),
  because a name it occupies is occupied regardless of who owns the server.

WILDCARD FAIL-SAFE (rows 10-12): kiro-cli documents ``@server/tool`` and
``@server`` for ``tools`` and globs only for ``allowedTools``, so ``@slug/*`` in
``tools`` may expose everything or nothing. It is read as whole-server because
the two errors are not symmetric: over-reading exposes a tool that is not
mounted, and renaming an unmounted tool is inert; under-reading leaves a real
collision shadowed.

DESTINATION RESERVATION: a generated name must not land on a name already in
use, or the rename recreates the shadowing it exists to remove. Reserved =
surviving hand-authored alias targets + declared natural names of exposed
providers + every tool name named in a per-tool ``tools`` ref of ANY exposed
server (custom servers included) + the builtin names in ``tools``.

  OUT OF SCOPE BY CONSTRUCTION: a custom server mounted WHOLE (``@mycustom``
  with no per-tool refs) publishes its tool names only at runtime, over the
  wire. Nothing in a static spec can name them, so a generated destination
  colliding with one is undetectable HERE by construction -- not merely
  unhandled. It degrades to shadowing (the fail-safe direction) and belongs to a
  runtime tool-list reconciliation, not to spec emission.

INVARIANTS 1-7 are this module's and decide WHICH aliases resolve. The emission
pass carries three of its own (staleness, destination safety, gate-off
inertness); see :func:`kiro_crew.agent._apply_connection_tool_aliases`.

1. **Aliases are registry-sourced only.** Every alias comes from a provider's
   committed ``tool_aliases`` declaration. Nothing is synthesized from a prefix
   rule at emission time, and nothing is learned by probing a live server -- a
   spec rebuild must not depend on network reachability.

2. **Collision detection is deterministic and closed over the EXPOSED set.**
   A tool name collides iff two or more identity-verified providers EXPOSE it.
   Same inputs always give the same output, key order included (sorted).

3. **A non-colliding tool keeps its natural name.** A declaration alone never
   renames anything, and neither does provider-level co-residence: two providers
   mounted per-tool on tools that do not overlap are not a collision.

4. **Exposure means MOUNTED, at tool granularity.** Rows 1-18 above.

5. **Provider identity is proven by endpoint, not assumed from the key.** A
   declaration says "MY tools collide", which is only true of the real provider.
   Eligibility requires the entry's ``url`` to match the registry's pinned
   ``mcp_url``. (The ``x-kirocrew`` provenance marker cannot serve here: by
   design it appears only in files Kiro Crew does not own, and is stripped on the
   way into both the store and the rendered spec -- see
   :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_provenance`.)

6. **Every failure degrades to shadowing, never to a wrong rename.** An
   unreadable registry, an unknowable custom tool list, a retired endpoint: each
   leaves tool names alone, which is the pre-feature behaviour, not a new defect.

7. **Ownership of an already-written pair is PERSISTED, never inferred from its
   shape.** Cleanup deletes entries out of a file the user also edits, so it needs
   proof that this pass wrote them -- and the shape of a name carries no such
   proof. Three shape rules were tried and each deleted a hand-written alias or
   stranded a real one permanently; the reasoning is recorded in
   :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.alias_record`, which now owns the decision. This
   module therefore computes only what SHOULD be emitted; what may be REMOVED is
   read from that record. :func:`derived_alias` is the name generator, not an
   ownership test.

Eligible providers are identified by registry slug because Connect keys the MCP
store by slug and the emitted ``mcpServers`` key is that slug verbatim.
