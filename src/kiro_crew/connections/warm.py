"""The shared warm mint: the specs one kiro-cli process serves, and the rows it holds.

The cold path (:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.mint`) pays a full kiro-cli spawn PER provider
for one approval URL. The warm design serves every card's URL from ONE process instead:
mode activation costs a FIXED ~5.18s whether the spec carries one remote server or six, so
a spec holding every mintable provider yields every ``oauth_request`` in a SINGLE
activation.

Three halves have landed. The TABLE: the row shape a shared mint uses (``shared`` /
``generation`` / ``activation`` on :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.mint.MintState`) and the
withdrawal chokepoint the dashboard's status path calls (:func:`expire_dead_mints`). The
SPECS: the registry scan deciding which providers a warm process could serve
(:func:`warm_spec_providers`), the plan it would spawn on (:func:`_warm_spec_plan`), and
the spec files that plan writes (:func:`_write_warm_mint_specs`). The RUNTIME: the one
process every card shares (:class:`_WarmMintRuntime`) -- spawned, activated, parked, killed
and reaped (:func:`_warm_mint_reaper`) -- and the flow that turns one activation into a
whole table of URLs (:func:`warm_mint_all`).

Redeemability takes TWO questions and they die independently: the PKCE verifier lives in
the PROCESS (``generation_is_live``) while the loopback listener answering the redirect
belongs to the SESSION (``activation_is_live``). Process liveness alone passed a
terminated-session row, which is how a card kept serving an unredeemable URL. Both
failures are recorded in ``docs/system-specs/modules/connections.md``.

Four rules are load-bearing and recorded in that same note: the SESSION is HELD (see
:func:`_warm_row_alive`), specs are enumerated ONCE at spawn -- which fixes the mode's
mounted server set for the life of the process, so a plan that merely SHRANK is servable but
NOT reusable and respawns, with a process still holding a consent PARKED rather than killed
(:func:`_plan_is_servable`,
:func:`_resident_roster_is_asked_for`, :meth:`_WarmMintRuntime._park_or_kill_locked`), the
spec universe is registry-derived and BLIND to grant and cancel state because a plan
tracking who needs a URL now retires a process holding other cards' listeners, and a warm
session injects an EMPTY ``mcp_servers`` list because remote servers passed through
``session/new`` kill the process with every pending verifier in it
(:func:`_warm_session_mcp_servers`).

IDENTITY: a row is fenced by its own opaque ``token``, never by the batch clock reading in
``started``. ``time.monotonic()`` has ~15.6ms granularity on Windows, so two Connects for
one provider inside a tick read as one row and a late absorb overwrites the newer claim --
the same reasoning
:func:`~kiro_crew.connections.mint._new_mint_token` records for the cold engine. WITHDRAWAL
is the other axis and does NOT use the token: a row is expired because the process that
holds its verifier is gone, so :func:`_expire_shared_mints` narrows by ``generation`` only.

ATOMICITY: :func:`_claim_shared_mints` contains no await, so a caller either holds every
claim it asked for or none -- the claim is taken before :func:`warm_mint_all` enters the
``try`` that rolls it back, which makes any await in that loop an unprotected cancel window.
The rows a claim displaced come back to the caller and are disposed inside that ``try``.

CANCELLATION SAFETY is the invariant this module is written around, because two review
rounds found the same bug class: an await sitting between a state mutation and that
mutation's settlement or cleanup, guarded only by an ``except Exception`` that a
``CancelledError`` walks straight past. Every such window is closed the same way -- the
mutation is either atomic by construction (no await in it) or its cleanup is a ``finally``
/ ``except BaseException`` that re-raises. Concretely: a claim rolls back
(:func:`warm_mint_all`), an activation's session is ALWAYS settled so the sweep can collect
it (:func:`_absorb_warm_requests`), and a process whose teardown did not finish stays
PARKED with a drain armed rather than losing its only reference
(:meth:`_WarmMintRuntime._park_or_kill_locked`, ``_sweep_retiring_locked``,
``_retire_locked``, ``_abandon_spawn_locked``). Pinned by an AST guard in
``test/test_connections_warm.py``, not merely described here.

SESSION OWNERSHIP is explicit at every transfer, because the handle is the ONLY way to
terminate a backend session and the loopback callback children it owns. One rule covers
every point: a handle is REGISTERED in ``_sessions`` before anything can be interrupted, and
FORGOTTEN only once its destroy has completed -- so an interrupted teardown leaves a record
the ordinary sweep retries. The create is run as a shielded task so its handle stays
reachable even when the wait for it is abandoned
(:meth:`_WarmMintRuntime._abandon_session_creation_locked`). When no handle can be recovered
at all the generation is QUARANTINED rather than trusted to retire on its own, which bounds
the unaddressable residual to one generation's sessions -- retirement is not guaranteed to
arrive, because a card holding a URL keeps the reaper's idle clock reset while the digest fast
path keeps the same process reusable.

LIVENESS is asked of the parked list too. A generation keeps its NUMBER while parked -- only
a successful spawn bumps the counter -- so ``generation_is_live`` uses the equality test to
CONFIRM liveness and never to deny it, then falls through to ``_retiring``. Denying on
equality reported a stood-down-but-alive process dead, which withdrew redeemable URLs and
then let the next sweep kill the process the park existed to preserve.

OWNERSHIP is checked twice, because a spec is activated BY NAME. The writer refuses a path
whose contents this module did not write, which protects the FILE; :func:`_unowned_plan_specs`
then re-verifies every planned spec exists and is ours BEFORE the runtime is constructed,
which protects the SPAWN. Without the second check the refusal would hand kiro-cli a
stranger's spec at our fixed name and initialize its ``mcpServers``. A refusal aborts
warming entirely, audited: the cold path still serves every Connect.

OWNERSHIP: mode names remain fixed, but their files live only in one random, owner-only
PROJECT scope under ``<data home>/run/connections-warm/generations``. That generation root is
the runtime cwd, so both the initial ``--agent`` and later ``session/set_mode`` resolve the
private ``.kiro/agents`` files before the user's global scope; the picker refuses the sensitive
run tree. Every spec is still stamped with :data:`_WARM_SPEC_SENTINEL`, because content proof
protects same-user races and licenses one-time cleanup of sentinel-owned global leftovers.
An unsentinelled global file is never auto-deleted: a name cannot prove ownership.

GENERATION LIFETIME follows the process. Its PID-reuse-resistant owner marker is written
before spawn and completed with the child identity after spawn. Parking or a failed kill keeps
the directory attached; a confirmed kill releases it. Gateway startup scavenges only roots
whose gateway and runtime identities are both provably dead, while graceful cleanup retires the
live singleton. Missing, malformed or unreadable evidence fails closed to retained clutter.

INVARIANT: no coroutine here touches the filesystem directly. The spec helpers read the
user's config, private generation tree, global legacy agents dir, or kiro-cli's OAuth cache,
and the credential gate reads the operator's OAuth-endpoint extension -- any of which can sit
on a network mount where a stat is unbounded -- so they are synchronous, and a coroutine
reaches them through ``asyncio.to_thread``. Enforced by a fixed-point drift guard in
``test/test_connections_warm.py``, not merely described here.

REQUEST PATH: :func:`warm_mint_all` is driven by ``POST /api/connections/premint``, which the
Connections page fires once on mount. It scans the candidates and hands them over, so the slugs
it reports and the rows the engine claims come from one registry read. The consumer of what it
warms is :func:`adopt_shared_mint`, which ``POST /api/connections/mint`` tries BEFORE reserving
a row of its own -- without it that endpoint's ``reserve_mint_row`` popped the shared row and
disposed the very URL the click had been warmed for. A table miss re-drains the newest live
shared session that activated the provider and retries adoption before the dedicated cold path.

RESILIENCE is lifecycle-owned by the same reaper that detects process death. An explicit page
warm arms ONE automatic replacement. The dead generation reserves one single-flight re-arm task,
which reuses the ordinary tri-state candidate scan and ``warm_mint_all`` path without granting
itself another attempt. Concurrent observers share that task; deliberate shutdown disarms and
cancels it before retiring the process. No provider-level recovery state crosses the API.
Proactive refresh attaches in :func:`_warm_mint_reaper` when its dependent slice lands.

TWO AXES, and conflating them is what the handoff had to separate. ``shared`` is OWNERSHIP: an
unclaimed premint any Connect may adopt, and the only mark a row still ``minting`` carries.
``generation``/``activation`` is PROVENANCE: the verifier lives in the shared process, so
:func:`_warm_row_alive` judges redeemability however the row is owned. Adoption clears the first
and keeps the second, so every warm-side predicate keys on :func:`_warm_table_row` -- the
disjunction -- and the cold engine's ``_mint_holder_alive`` ABSTAINS on a row carrying a
``generation`` rather than reading its absent ``client`` as death.

    initializes are fixed by the spec the NAMED mode carried when the process started --
    rewriting the file afterwards moves nothing, and passing the wanted subset through
    ``session/new`` kills the process with every pending verifier in it. The mounted set is
    therefore not a thing an activation can narrow: the only way to stop initializing a
    provider is to stop using the mode that lists it.

    So a plan that merely SHRANK is servable but not reusable IN BULK: the resident
    all-agent mode still lists the excluded provider, ``set_mode`` initializes its MCP
    server, and an authorization request goes out for exactly the provider
    :func:`_warm_mintable_entry` vetoed -- filtering the RESULT leaves that request made.
    A strict shrink therefore respawns, which is not the same as stranding a peer: a process
    still holding a redeemable code is PARKED, keeps its generation live, and is retired by
    the drain once its rows are gone.

    Paired with -- never a substitute for -- :func:`_plan_is_servable`. Servability alone
    reuses a shrink, which is the defect this exists to close; the two together admit reuse
    only for a roster that is neither more nor less than what the scan asked for.

    no row was adoptable at this instant; the public flow may recover a late frame from the

    every write in :func:`~kiro_crew.connections.mint._mint_watcher` is guarded on the
    token it was started with -- so rotating alone would leave the row watched by a
    task that cannot touch it: nothing would flip it to ``granted``, nothing
    would expire it, and it would hold the shared process resident for good. Re-arming
    is therefore part of the same synchronous run, not a follow-up.

    ``time.monotonic()`` reading cannot do that job: it has ~15.6ms granularity on Windows,
    so two Connects for one provider inside a single tick read as the same row and a late
    absorb writes its URL over the newer claim (see ``_new_mint_token``, which records the
    same reasoning for the cold engine).

    ATOMIC BY CONSTRUCTION: the loop contains NO await, so the caller either gets every
    claim or none. Awaiting ``_dispose_mint`` on each replaced row would suspend
    on a client teardown and again on the shielded spec removal in that function's
    ``finally`` -- and the claim is taken BEFORE ``warm_mint_all`` enters the try that rolls
    it back, so a cancellation there would leave earlier slugs installed as ``minting`` with no
    caller holding their tokens. Nothing withdraws such a row (``expire_dead_mints`` judges
    ``waiting`` only) and it keeps ``_shared_mints_pending`` true, so the process is never
    retired either. The replaced rows come back for the caller to dispose INSIDE that try
    instead -- which also puts the dispose outside the table lock, where the mint engine's
    own rule wants it.
