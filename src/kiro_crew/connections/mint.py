"""On-demand minting of a Connections provider's OAuth approval URL.

A mint is one dedicated kiro-cli process running a single-server agent spec. Its
session is created with no prompt and makes no model call: MCP initialization is
eager, so the server's OAuth challenge is buffered during init and readable as
soon as the session is ready.

The process is HELD once the URL is in hand, not disposed. The PKCE verifier is a
value in that process's memory and the loopback listener that answers the
provider's redirect is one of that session's MCP children, so a mint torn down
after the drain leaves a redirect port that accepts a connect and then resets
every real exchange -- consent the provider renders and no paste can redeem. The
hold ends on a terminal condition only: a grant appears on disk, the TTL
expires, a newer mint supersedes this one, or the server initializes without
challenging.

Because the process is held while nothing claims it as a session, its PID is
registered with the orphan-sweep protection set for exactly that span. Without
it the periodic sweep reaps the mint once it ages past the spawn grace, which
takes the verifier and the listener with it and leaves a published URL that
cannot be redeemed.

INVARIANT: no filesystem operation in this module executes on the event loop.

Every flow here touches disk -- the user's home for a grant, the shared agents
directory for a spec, our own state dir for the manifest -- and any of those can
sit on a network mount, where a stat is unbounded rather than sub-millisecond. On
the loop one such stall takes every other request and the gateway's heartbeat with
it. So the filesystem-touching helpers are all plain synchronous functions, and
every async boundary that needs one runs it through ``asyncio.to_thread``: the
aged-spec sweep, the spec write, the spec removal, the grant read, the agents-dir
read, the data-home resolution, and the SEL audits -- the flow outcome and the
grant-presence observation -- whose first call in a process constructs the
security event log before it can enqueue anything. The
removal is additionally shielded, because it also releases a file that agent
discovery would otherwise offer as a selectable agent -- see :func:`_dispose_mint`.

The invariant is enforced rather than described: a drift guard derives both sides
of it from this module's own AST -- which helpers reach a filesystem primitive,
and what each coroutine calls directly -- so a new helper that touches disk cannot
be called straight from a coroutine without failing the suite.

    that alone is how a Connect click on Stripe or Vercel flipped instantly to
    Connected, then fell to "not authorized" once the expensive Test action forced
    kiro-cli's own refresh and the pair turned out to be dead.

    This spawns the SAME single-server ephemeral session a fresh mint would spawn

    Unlike Test, this call owns its OWN process rather than reaching for the

    would turn a bounded reconnect into the cost of a cold start elsewhere, and a

    kiro-cli would otherwise destroy a live refresh token that is not recoverable

    Bounded to one attempt inside one deadline: this is a reconnect confirming a
    grant that is supposed to already work, not a retry loop.

    Never raises. EVERY step lives inside the guarded block, including the client
    factory and the spec write -- ``_write_mint_agent_spec`` raises ``OSError`` on
    an unusable main spec or an unrecordable manifest row, and this runs on a
    fire-and-forget task BEFORE the caller's own try, so an escape would kill the
    flow and strand the row at ``minting`` with no terminal state for the card to
    read. ``holdings`` is therefore initialized before the try, so the ``finally``
