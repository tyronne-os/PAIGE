"""Persisted record of the ``toolAliases`` pairs the alias pass itself emitted.

WHY A RECORD EXISTS
===================
The alias pass must clean up its OWN stale emissions: a renamed or withdrawn
registry declaration leaves a superseded ``@slug/tool -> alias`` pair behind in
the spec, and a rename that outlives its collision recreates the shadowing the
feature exists to remove. So cleanup needs to answer "did I write this pair?".

Answering it from the pair's SHAPE was tried three ways and each failed, because
shape asks about the present while ownership is a fact about the PAST:

* ``alias.startswith(f"{slug}_")`` claims a user's hand-written
  ``@linear/list_issues -> linear_issues``, so a rebuild deletes a deliberate
  edit.
* ``alias == f"{slug}_{tool}"`` (re-derivation) claims a user's hand-written
  ``@notion/search -> notion_search`` even though ``notion`` declares no aliases
  at all and this pass has never emitted anything for it. The shape of a name the
  pass WOULD emit is no evidence that it DID.
* Narrowing re-derivation to slugs that currently declare aliases reintroduces
  the first failure from the other side: a withdrawn declaration takes its slug
  out of the test, so the pair that declaration stranded stops being recognised
  as ours and becomes permanently unclearable.

Shape cannot decide history. This module persists the history instead: exactly
the ``(slug, tool, alias)`` triples the LAST pass emitted.

WHY THE RECORD IS GENERATION-BOUND
==================================
The record and the spec are two files, and kiro-cli validates specs with
``deny_unknown_fields``, so an ownership marker cannot live inside the spec -- an
extra key makes kiro-cli reject the whole file and the user loses every tool.
Two files means two writes, and no ORDERING of two writes closes both failure
directions: record-after-spec leaves an emitted-but-unrecorded pair, and
record-before-spec leaves a record claiming a pair the spec never carried, which
is what deletes a name the user has since hand-written.

Ordering is therefore not the variable. The record instead carries a
**fingerprint of the spec generation it describes**, and a write is a two-phase
transaction, so a record can never be silently mistaken for a description of a
spec it does not match:

    PENDING(previous=(fp(old map), old claim), target=(fp(new map), new emission))
    -> spec write
    -> COMMITTED(fp(new map), new emission)

A ``COMMITTED`` record describes a spec write that is already durable, and it is
consulted only as a description of THAT generation: its stored fingerprint must
equal the map on disk. On the normal path it always does -- the record is written
right after its spec write, and the next pass replaces it with a ``PENDING``
record before touching the spec -- so the gate is inert and the happy path, and a
user's hand-edit, behave exactly as they would with no transaction at all
(invariant 3 still decides each pair). The gate earns its keep when the record
OUTLIVES its spec: delete or replace the spec out of band and an ungated
committed record would still name triples, authorizing the deletion of an alias
that is by then the user's only copy.

A ``PENDING`` record is the interrupted case, and the fingerprint resolves it:
whichever of its two candidate generations matches the map on disk is the one
that is really there.

THE STATE TABLE (every reachable crash boundary, both directions)
=================================================================
``M`` is the spec's ``toolAliases`` map; ``C`` the claim the pass was authorised
to strip; ``E`` what it emitted. Read "resolves to" as what the NEXT pass treats
as its own and may therefore delete.

===  ==============================  ================  ========  ==================================
 #   interrupted at                  record on disk    map       resolves to
===  ==============================  ================  ========  ==================================
 0   before the pending write        unchanged         M_old     unchanged -- pass is a no-op retry
 1   pending write FAILS             unchanged         M_old     unchanged; spec MUST NOT advance
 2   kill after pending write        PENDING           M_old     previous candidate -> C
 3   spec write FAILS                PENDING           M_old     previous candidate -> C
 4   kill after spec write           PENDING           M_new     target candidate -> E
 5   commit write FAILS              PENDING           M_new     target candidate -> E
 6   nothing (success)               COMMITTED         M_new     E
 7   record absent/unusable/v1       --                any       nothing (invariant 4)
 8   map hand-edited under PENDING   PENDING           M_other   nothing -- neither candidate matches
 9   spec replaced/removed out of    COMMITTED         M_other   nothing -- fingerprint gate rejects it
     band under COMMITTED
===  ==============================  ================  ========  ==================================

Row 7 covers a record that is absent, unreadable, malformed, written by an older
version, or carrying no syntactically valid fingerprint: none of those describes a
generation, so none may authorize a deletion.

Row 9 is the orphaned committed record: the transaction completed, then the spec
it described was deleted or rewritten by something that is not this pass. The
record is intact and internally consistent, so only the EQUALITY gate can tell
that it does not describe anything on disk. Without that gate it would claim
triples the current map may hold from another source -- a user's own alias -- and
strip them.

Both directions are safe on every row, simultaneously:

* **Never deletes a user's exact hand-written alias.** Rows 2/3 resolve to the
  claim that was already valid for the map still on disk, so nothing new is
  claimed. Rows 4/5 resolve to ``E``, which by construction contains only pairs
  this pass wrote. Rows 7/8/9 claim nothing. And on every row invariant 3 still
  requires the whole triple to match, so an edited alias is never claimed.
* **Never permanently strands a generated alias.** Rows 4/5 resolve to ``E``, so
  an interrupted transaction is RECONCILED by the next pass rather than
  abandoned. Rows 2/3 leave the spec unchanged, so there is nothing to strand.
  Row 1 fails closed for the same reason.

Rows 7 and 9 are where a generated pair does become permanently the user's:
losing the record file outright, or losing the spec generation the record
described. Both are invariant 4's deliberate degradation (stale aliases linger,
which is the pre-feature shadowing), and neither is reachable by a write failure
or a kill -- only by deleting or replacing one of the two files out of band.

INVARIANTS
==========
1. **The record is the only ownership oracle.** A pair is this pass's own iff the
   resolved record holds it. Absence proves nothing except "not provably ours",
   which is the safe reading -- an unrecorded pair is treated as the user's and
   survives. No shape rule, prefix test or re-derivation participates.

2. **The record AUTHORIZES deletion, so it must never OVERSTATE.** The
   fingerprint is what enforces that across a crash: a record is consulted only
   as a description of a specific spec generation, and a description that cannot
   be matched to the map on disk claims nothing. This holds for BOTH statuses --
   a committed record that does not match the map on disk has outlived its
   spec (row 9) and claims nothing either.

3. **Membership IS the byte-equality test.** The alias is part of the key, so a
   pair is claimed only when the spec's CURRENT value matches the recorded form
   byte for byte. A user who edits a generated alias produces a triple the record
   does not hold, so their edit is left alone; no separate comparison is needed
   and none may be added, or the two checks could disagree.

4. **A missing, unreadable or malformed record is EMPTY, and empty claims
   NOTHING.** Losing the record degrades to "every pair is the user's": stale
   aliases linger (shadowing, the pre-feature behaviour) rather than a user's
   entries being deleted on a bad parse. Individual entries that are not three
   strings are dropped for the same reason -- dropping understates. A record
   written by an older version reads as empty too: carrying a v1 record forward
   would inherit exactly the unverifiable claim this version exists to prevent.
   So does a record whose fingerprint is not the shape
   :func:`spec_fingerprint` produces (64 lowercase hex): it names no generation,
   and the committed branch's freedom from an EQUALITY gate is only sound while
   the record is demonstrably this writer's.

5. **The TRANSITION belongs to the writer of the spec, not to the alias pass.**
   :func:`~kiro_crew.agent.rebuild_agent_config` opens and commits it around its own
   spec write, for EVERY write that changes the map -- including a clean rebuild and
   one where the alias pass never runs. A clean write replaces the map wholesale, so
   a claim left describing the replaced generation is the same deletion hazard a
   crash would produce. When the map does not change, the transition is skipped
   entirely: rewriting the record empty there would forget a real emission and
   strand every pair it named.

6. **Both record writes are LOUD, and the pending write FAILS CLOSED.**
   :func:`~kiro_crew.atomic_write.atomic_write` publishes through a temp file and
   a rename and leaves the destination alone on failure, so a failed write means
   the record still describes the PREVIOUS generation. That is safe only while
   the spec also still is that generation -- so a failed pending write must stop
   the pass before it touches the spec (row 1), and a failed commit write leaves
   the pending record, which row 5 resolves correctly. Both raise rather than
   swallow: the spec is durable and correct, but an unwritable data home is
   reported when it happens instead of surfacing later as aliases nobody can
   explain.

7. **The fingerprint is taken over the AUTHORITATIVE on-disk map.** Resolution
   compares against the spec generation that is really on disk, read inside the
   same critical section that writes it. A fingerprint taken over a stale
   in-memory snapshot would match a generation that is not there, which is
   the one way the fingerprint could certify a claim it should have rejected.

The record is process-wide rather than per-spec because
:func:`~kiro_crew.agent.rebuild_agent_config` writes one canonical spec, and that
pass is the only emitter.
