"""Keep a POSIX setup subprocess group anchored until all descendants exit.

Also applies the caller's resource limits. This runs AFTER ``exec``, in a
single-threaded process, which is the whole point: applying them via
``preexec_fn`` instead forced CPython to ``fork()`` the multi-GB, ~118-thread
gateway and run Python in the child before ``exec``. Locks other threads held at
fork time are unreleasable there, so the child deadlocked in a futex, never
exec'd, and never exited -- while pinning every fd it inherited (see the
gateway.lock reclaim fix). Limits set here are inherited by the exec'd child and
all of its descendants, so coverage is unchanged.
