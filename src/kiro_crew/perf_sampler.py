"""Debug-only statistical stack sampler.

KiroCrew has aggregate duration histograms (``kiro_crew.metrics``) and a stall
detector that dumps thread stacks when the event loop wedges
(``dashboard.loop_watchdog``), but nothing that attributes CPU/wall time to
call paths. This module is the missing piece: a sampling profiler that turns a
window of execution into folded stacks, which speedscope, flamegraph.pl and
Perfetto all import directly.

Two sampling strategies, because they answer different questions:

* **In-process** (:class:`StackSampler`) -- a daemon thread wakes on an interval
  and reads every other thread's stack via :func:`sys._current_frames`. Needs no
  extra privileges, no third-party package, and works on macOS and Windows. It
  can only see the process it runs in, so it profiles a command executed by the
  CLI, not a gateway already running elsewhere.
* **Out-of-process** (:func:`pyspy_argv`) -- py-spy attaches to a foreign PID.
  This is the only way to profile an already-running gateway, and it is
  deliberately optional: py-spy needs ``task_for_pid`` on macOS, which the OS
  denies without elevated privileges (the same constraint that made
  ``loop_watchdog`` prefer an in-process ``faulthandler`` timer over an external
  py-spy capture). When py-spy is missing or refused, the caller reports that
  instead of silently producing nothing.

Nothing here runs unless a CLI command asks for it. There is no import-time
hook, no background thread at rest, and no HTTP surface -- see
:func:`profiling_enabled` for the gate.
