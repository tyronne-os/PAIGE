"""Pre-flight: can systemd's own domain execute the binary we are about to
name in ``ExecStart``?

On an SELinux-enforcing host where kirocrew is installed under ``$HOME`` — the
default on Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue/Kinoite and every other atomic desktop —
a **system**-scope unit at ``/etc/systemd/system`` can never start. PID 1 runs
in the ``init_t`` domain, the binary carries a home label (``user_home_t``), and
the loaded policy does not grant ``init_t`` ``execute`` on that label. ``execve``
returns ``EACCES`` and systemd reports ``status=203/EXEC``, which it then repeats
until ``StartLimitBurst`` is exhausted.

**Why this needs a dedicated check instead of an ordinary file test.** ``203/EXEC``
has several causes that are indistinguishable in the unit's status output: the
path does not exist, it is not executable, its shebang interpreter is wrong, or
the file is *perfectly fine* and SELinux refused the execute. Only the last one
survives every check an installer would normally run — the policy grants
``getattr`` on a home-labelled file while denying ``execute``, so ``os.access(...,
X_OK)`` / ``test -x`` return **True** and the file looks correct right up to the
moment systemd tries to run it. A mode check therefore cannot answer this
question; the only thing that can is the policy itself.

So we ask the policy directly, through the kernel's ``compute_av`` interface
(``/sys/fs/selinux/access``). That is a pure query — it decides nothing, relabels
nothing, needs no root, and writes no state anywhere on the host.

**Mechanism-based, never distro-based** — the same rule :mod:`kiro_crew.service
.apparmor` states for its own gate, for the same reason: an ID check would miss
every derivative (Bazzite is a Fedora derivative of a derivative) and would
wrongly fire on a Fedora host that installed kirocrew system-wide, or one whose
operator has loaded a policy module granting the access. Nothing here matches a
distro name, a version, or even a *type* name. Every input is read from the
running kernel:

* enforcing state from ``/sys/fs/selinux/enforce``,
* the domain that will do the ``execve`` from ``/proc/1/attr/current`` (whatever
  PID 1 actually is on this host, not a hardcoded ``init_t``),
* the file's label from its ``security.selinux`` xattr,
* the verdict from the loaded policy.

**It fires only on a proven positive, and fails OPEN everywhere else.** SELinux
absent, permissive, an unreadable label, a kernel that refuses the query, a
policy whose source domain is *per-domain permissive* — every one of those
returns "not blocked" and the install proceeds exactly as it did before this
module existed. A pre-flight that guesses wrong in the refusing direction would
break installs that work today, which is strictly worse than the bug it prevents.

**No override knob, deliberately.** The check reads the live policy, so an
operator who loads a policy module granting the access flips it off by itself —
``compute_av`` starts answering ALLOW and the gate goes quiet with no flag to
remember. An escape hatch could only ever re-enable an install that provably
crash-loops.

**Coverage boundary, stated because it is reachable.** This answers exactly one
question: may PID 1's domain execute the file systemd itself ``execve``s at unit
start, and the interpreter its shebang names? It does NOT and cannot cover what
that file goes on to exec at RUNTIME. A ``KIROCREW_SERVICE_BIN`` override naming a
system-labelled wrapper that later runs a binary under ``$HOME`` therefore passes
this gate and still fails to serve — with the shell's exit 126, not ``203/EXEC``,
since the wrapper itself execs fine.

That hole cannot be closed soundly here. Following the delegation would mean
deciding what an arbitrary shell script executes, and the weaker version —
scanning a wrapper for path-shaped literals — would refuse installs over a path in
a comment or an untaken branch, because a literal appearing in a script is not
proof it is ever executed. Refusing on "cannot inspect" is the same violation from
the other side. So the boundary is left where soundness puts it, and
:func:`kiro_crew.service.linux.install` covers the residue at the point of failure
instead: when the unit is written and the first ``systemctl restart`` fails on an
enforcing host, its error names SELinux as a candidate and prints the same
user-scope remedy. Nothing is left silently unexplained, and no install that would
have worked is refused.
