"""Static AST validation for dynamic-workflow scripts (GATE group B, static half).

A workflow script is LLM-authored code, so before the runner ``exec``s it we
statically reject the dangerous constructs and enforce the authoring shape:

* ``import`` / ``from ... import``            — B1 (no arbitrary modules; this also
                                                 blocks importing ``time``/``random``/
                                                 ``uuid`` → the static half of B3)
* references to ``eval``/``exec``/``compile``/``open``/``__import__``/...  — B1
* dunder attribute or name access (``().__class__``, ``__builtins__``)     — B2
* a pure-literal ``META`` dict + an ``async def workflow(ctx)`` entrypoint
* a script-size ceiling

This is only the *static* half of the sandbox. The runner provides the second
half: it ``exec``s the script with a restricted ``__builtins__`` containing only
``SAFE_BUILTINS`` (plus ``ctx``), which is what actually makes ``time``/``random``/
``uuid`` unreachable at run time (the dynamic half of B3) and blocks filesystem/
socket egress (B7).

Spec: ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``. Never relax a check here without
a matching update to the invariant tests (GATE group B in
``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``).
