"""Background run registry for dynamic workflows.

Lets a workflow run **outlive a single request** and be addressed by ``run_id``
from anywhere — chat MCP tools, the Workflows dashboard tab, and result-to-chat
injection all share one registry. Without this, a run is just a synchronous
``WorkflowRunner.run()`` call that nobody can monitor, cancel, or fetch later.

A ``RunHandle`` holds the live state of one run: status, the event list as it
grows, the final result/error, the originating session (for result injection),
and the ``asyncio.Task`` driving it (for cancellation). The registry schedules
runs on the running event loop and tracks them in-memory (bounded LRU).

Thread-safety: the registry is loop-affine — all mutation happens on the gateway
event loop, so no locks are needed for the in-process store. Snapshots returned
to callers are plain dicts (JSON-serializable, never the live objects).
