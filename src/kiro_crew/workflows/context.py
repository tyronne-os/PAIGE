"""Run-scoped execution context for dynamic workflows (GATES A4, B6, B3-runtime, B7).

This is the ``context`` layer (``dsl`` → ``context`` → ``runner``; GATE F1). It
provides the pieces the runner needs to execute a workflow script safely and
within ceilings, WITHOUT importing the runner or any heavy gateway code:

* ``Budget`` — token accounting with a HARD ceiling (GATE A4). ``charge()`` past
  ``total`` raises ``BudgetExceeded``; ``remaining()`` is ``math.inf`` when
  ``total is None``. Satisfies the frozen ``Budget`` Protocol (conformance F2).
* ``AgentCounter`` — per-run lifetime agent-call cap (GATE B6 backstop).
* ``build_safe_globals()`` — the restricted ``globals`` the runner ``exec``s a
  script in: only ``validate.SAFE_BUILTINS`` plus the injected ``ctx`` are
  reachable, so ``time``/``random``/``uuid``/``open``/``__import__`` are absent at
  run time (B3 runtime half) and there is no filesystem/socket capability (B7).

The concrete ``WorkflowContext`` that wires ``dsl.parallel/pipeline``, agents,
and the event stream is assembled by ``runner.py`` from these parts; keeping them
here lets the runner stay thin and keeps this layer dependency-light.

Spec: ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``.
