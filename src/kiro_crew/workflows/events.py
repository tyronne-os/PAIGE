"""Run-event construction + JSON serialization for dynamic workflows (GATES A7, B4).

The frozen event *vocabulary* — ``WorkflowEvent`` and ``EVENT_TYPES`` — lives in
``kiro_crew.workflows.__init__`` (the contract). This module is the layer the
runner uses to *build* well-formed events with the correct per-type ``data``
fields (the run event stream table in ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``),
assign monotonic ``seq`` numbers, and serialize to/from JSON.

GATE A7: the runner emits exactly the documented event stream; ``EventStream``
factory methods produce every type with its required ``data`` keys.

GATE B4: persistence is JSON only — ``serialize_events``/``deserialize_events``
go through ``json`` (never ``pickle``/``marshal``). ``loads`` rejects non-JSON.

This module holds no LLM/agent logic and has no side effects on import.
