"""Dynamic workflows for Kiro Crew — the FROZEN CONTRACT.

This module defines the interface-first freeze for the dynamic-workflows feature:
the ``WorkflowContext`` Protocol (the ``ctx`` DSL surface an authored workflow
script calls) and the run-event types that drive the UI and resume.

The runner, schema enforcement, the Workflows UI app, and the wrappers for the
ports native to Kiro Crew are all written against this contract — several of them
without importing it, so nothing but the conformance test catches a drift.
Changing a signature or event shape here is a re-freeze and must update that test
(GATE F2 in ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``).

Spec: ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``.
Gate catalog: ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``.

NOTE: This module is intentionally implementation-free. It declares Protocols and
typed event records only. ``import``-ing it must have no side effects.
