"""Abort-push: the gateway tells gatewayd to cancel in-flight tool calls.

On hard stop (session reset), the gateway sends an ``abort`` frame over the
gatewayd unix socket naming the runtime PID(s) of the killed session::

    {"type": "abort", "pids": [<pid1>, ...], "reason": "session hard-stop"}

gatewayd looks up every live stub connection indexed under those PIDs (via the
same ``_CONN_INDEX`` ancestry index used by claim-push) and emits MCP
``notifications/cancelled`` for each of that caller's in-flight request ids.
This stops tool work that was executing inside pooled backends.

Trust model: same uid-gated 0700 unix socket as Register/Claim — the gateway
is the authority. A valid abort frame always takes effect.

Import-light on purpose: imported from ``session.py`` hot paths. The only
non-stdlib import is ``mcp_gateway.transport`` (chain: ``transport ->
platform_compat -> executors``, no config loader), needed because the
endpoint is a unix socket on POSIX and a named pipe on Windows.
