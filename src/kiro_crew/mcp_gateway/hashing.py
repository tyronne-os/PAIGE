"""Stable command-args and effective-env hashing shared across the MCP gateway.

Kept in its own dependency-free leaf module (only ``hashlib``) so every caller
imports it at module top level. The lightweight ``rewriter`` sits on
``config.loader``'s import path, while ``pool`` and ``stub`` are asyncio/socket
-heavy submodules that must stay unloaded until the gateway is actually enabled
(``test_loader_does_not_import_mcp_gateway_at_module_load``). Routing the shared
hash through this leaf lets the rewriter import it directly without dragging
those heavy submodules into CLI/test/MCP startup.

#: Env-key prefixes treated as ROTATING SECRETS and excluded from the
#: ``effective_env_hash`` PoolKey dimension, so a credential rotation does not
#: split an otherwise-identical pool.
#:
#: The exclusion has a second, security-critical consequence: it makes the hash
#: NON-INJECTIVE over these keys. Two sessions whose only difference is an
#: ``AWS_SECRET*`` value collide onto the same hash and therefore SHARE one
#: backend — so there is no single correct value for a secret-prefixed key in a
#: pooled backend, and one must never be forwarded into it. Servers that need a
#: per-session secret read it from disk (the platform credential helper / the
#: provider's default credential chain, unchanged by pooling) or stay ``poolable: false``.
#:
#: An operator can lift the exclusion for a NAMED variable via
#: ``mcp_gateway.pool_identity_env`` — see the ``identity_keys`` argument of
#: :func:`non_secret_env`. That is not a hole in the reasoning above, it is the
#: reasoning applied in reverse: naming a key makes it part of
#: ``effective_env_hash``, so the hash becomes INJECTIVE over it, two sessions
#: declaring different values no longer collide, and "no single correct value"
#: stops being true for that key. Forwarding it is then safe by exactly the
#: argument that already makes every other hashed key safe to forward.

    Forwarding applies a SECOND, independent filter on top of this one —

    part of the PoolKey, every session sharing a backend agrees on their values,
    so applying them at spawn cannot make one co-tenant observe another's
    configuration.

    It is not sufficient on its own: the forwarding path in ``gatewayd`` also
    drops ``manager.is_credential_env_key`` matches, so a declared credential
    key that the daemon scrub removes is never re-introduced.

    ``identity_keys`` names variables an operator has declared pool-identity-
