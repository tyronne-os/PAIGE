# ``.github/sync-io-in-async-baseline.txt``, all of it knowledge paths.
#
# ``dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py`` takes the store through a worker for every
# take of its OWN, endpoints and background tasks alike. It is not the whole
# story, so the claim is scoped deliberately: the connector branch of
# ``sync_source`` awaits ``SyncScheduler.sync_source``, which writes the row
# inline from an async method (``sync.py``'s ``update_source`` after a successful
# fetch, and ``_record_failure``), so a handler still reaches the store on the
# loop ONE FRAME DOWN. That path is interprocedural backlog, invisible to the
# lexical baseline, and stays with the cleanup rather than with this file.
#
# Two takes are left in the lexical baseline. The watcher's self-heal rebuild
# finalizes its job row inline on its cancellation path, where an interrupted
# ``to_thread`` could drop the write -- ``start_rebuild_job`` sweeps a stale
# 'processing' row to 'abandoned', so the single-flight guard recovers either
# way. And ``dashboard/state.py`` builds this store lazily, whose migrations run
# under ``allow_on_loop()`` below.
#
# * ``strict_env=STORE_STRICT_ENV`` keeps this store off the SHARED
#   ``KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST`` switch, which ``setup.py``'s ``test_e2e``
#   and ``ci.yml`` already export into the e2e gateway for history's clean
#   surface. On the shared flag, the watcher's finalize would raise inside the
#   e2e gateway.
# * ``dev_mode_arms_strict=False`` keeps a developer gateway from raising on that
#   same backlog, which would report tracked work as a regression and push the
#   developer to unset ``KIROCREW_DEV_MODE`` -- silencing history.py's guard too.

# For anything the reader transforms -- PDF, DOCX, HTML -- they differ and the

        The constructor runs `_migrate()` on every open, and that sweep takes the
        writer lock and deletes any itemless source row nothing references. That
        is the right cost for a surface that goes on to write and the wrong one
        for a verb documented as read-only -- `kirocrew knowledge stats` runs in
        a fresh process, so it would re-run the sweep on every invocation. Here
        the file is opened with SQLite `mode=ro`: nothing on this store can
        write, because the engine refuses rather than a convention asking. The
        trade is that a schema behind the code is reported, not repaired -- a
        read that meets a missing table or column raises
        `sqlite3.OperationalError`, and any migrating open (the gateway,
        `kirocrew knowledge dedup --apply`) is the fix.

        # first attempt that fails writes the column and quiesces the source for
        # good -- while an attempt that SUCCEEDS is the right outcome for a source
        # that had recovered. The column is authoritative; a value that cannot be
        # ordered against it does not get to overrule it.
        #
        # The copy is then RETIRED. This runs on EVERY open, so leaving the key in
        # place would make the repair above a standing reader of a value that goes
        # stale the moment a column-only writer moves the row. Retiring makes it a
        # one-time repair instead.
        #
        # The repair is compare-and-set on the row as READ -- the blob AND the
        # column -- so a concurrent writer wins and the row is converged by the
        # next open instead. The retirement predicates on the blob ALONE, which
        # is the only field it writes: a column-only transition is what every
        # live writer does, and requiring the column to be unmoved would abandon
        # the copy for exactly the transitions that are expected to happen.
        # No SQL prefilter on the blob text. A raw substring match cannot decide

        work is proportional to ``entities`` + ``entity_relations``, so doing it
        there stalls the gateway before the socket binds.

        **The offload is load-bearing, not hygiene.** Both handlers are
        ``async def`` and read the graph on the loop, where the loop-stall

        mutation-refresh sites acquire no lock of their own, so a first graph GET
        racing a source DELETE put two threads through the rebuild at once, and
        the loser's rows survived into a graph whose ``_graph_loaded`` was then
        set True -- a flag asserting "loaded" over data that is wrong, which is
        worse than an unloaded graph because it never gets rescanned.

        Serializing the whole rebuild also fixes WHICH snapshot wins: the SELECTs
        below run after acquisition, so the rebuild that acquires last reads the
        freshest committed state rather than replaying rows it captured earlier.

        **Build a fresh graph, then publish it with one reference assignment.**
        Clearing the live ``self._graph`` and re-adding row
        by row would be stale-publish-safe under serialization but leave the object a
        reader could be iterating momentarily empty: a reader holding
        ``self._graph`` between the ``clear()`` and the last insert would see a torn
        (empty or truncated) graph, and a multi-step reader that re-read
        ``self.graph`` across its own steps -- degree ranking, then per-node
        attribute reads -- could miss a node that ``clear()`` had just removed.
        Building into a NEW ``SimpleDiGraph`` and swapping the reference
        under the lock closes that window: the old object is never mutated, so a
        reader holding it sees a complete, consistent OLD graph until it drops the
        reference, and the next read sees the complete NEW one. The multi-step
        readers pin one reference for the duration of their read (see
        ``get_entity_subgraph`` / ``get_neighbors`` and the graph handlers) so a
        swap mid-read cannot mix old and new nodes.

        The lock is only ever taken here and in :meth:`ensure_graph_loaded`, and
        this method never takes SQLite's writer lock -- it is read-only, and all
        six refresh sites call it after their own COMMIT -- so there is no
        ordering against ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` to invert. (That is the hazard the

        holds no items for that document -- its state row is 'deduped' with an empty
        group -- yet it IS still a location of the winner's items, which is what keeps
        the document reachable if the winner goes away. When the losing copy is

        Identified by ``content_hash`` because that is the only handle such a row has:
        it owns no item ids, and the winner's ids must never be written into it -- a
        row naming another source's items becomes a second document over one physical
        item set, which self-collapses and deletes the survivor.

        Like adoption, this acts only when the hash picks out ONE document here. If a
        second document in this source holds identical text, the claim is shared and
        dropping it would strand that other document when the winner goes away. On
        ambiguity the claim is kept: a stale claim can resurface content that exists
