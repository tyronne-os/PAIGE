"""Claim preflight — the deterministic claim predicate for the pipeline conductor.

One invocation answers every cheap question about one candidate work item and
returns ONE verdict, so a worker dispatch is never spent discovering that the
work does not exist.

WHY FIVE QUESTIONS AND NOT ONE. The predicate this replaces was a single prose
line, ``gh pr list --search``, and it was blind in three directions at once.
Each blind spot cost a whole dispatch to discover:

  * an item already fixed by a MERGED PR was claimed and dispatched days later
    — an ``--state open`` query structurally cannot see a merged PR — with the
    reporter's own "happy to have it closed" sitting on the thread;
  * four dispatches went to items that each had an OPEN PR carrying
    ``Fixes #N``, because the predicate read one field
    (``closedByPullRequestsReferences``) that came back empty for all of them.
    It still does: measured on this repo, two items closed by merged PRs both
    answer ``[]``. That is why this script never asks that question at all — it
    reads the item's TIMELINE, which sees both the fork PRs and the merged ones;
  * three items said "I am claiming this issue" / "Ownership claimed by @X" in
    PROSE, in the body, which no label or field query sees.

The lesson those three share, and the design rule of this script: **one
question with an empty answer is not permission.** So it asks all five, and an
unanswerable question yields UNKNOWN — never CLAIM.

Usage:
    python3 claim_preflight.py --repo <owner/repo> --item <N>
                              [--default-branch main]
                              [--repo-dir <path to a clone of the base>]
                              [--json]

    --repo            ``owner/name`` of the forge repository holding the item
    --item            the issue number
    --default-branch  the git rev a worker would branch from, as it is spelled
                      in ``--repo-dir`` (``main``, ``origin/main``, …)
    --repo-dir        a clone of the base. Needed only for the two questions
                      git can answer: whether a merged PR actually LANDED on
                      that branch, and whether a symbol the item names exists
                      there. Omitting it is not an error — but if the item has
                      a merged PR or names a symbol, the answer becomes
                      UNKNOWN rather than a guess. The clone is read as-is and
                      never fetched: keeping it current is the caller's job,
                      and a merge commit missing from a stale clone reports
                      UNKNOWN, never "did not land".
    --json            print exactly one JSON object instead of the human line

Exit codes (the conductor branches on these):

    0   CLAIM    — dispatch it
   10   SKIP     — covered or not workable; do not dispatch
   11   CLOSE    — triage debt: a merged PR already landed the fix
   13   REVIEW   — a standing closure request was READ in the item's prose. Do
                   not dispatch and do not close: hand it to a human, or to the
                   conductor, with the reason. Prose noticing that something
                   might be resolved is not prose deciding it.
    2            — malformed arguments or config
    3   UNKNOWN  — a check could not be answered (forge unreachable, rate
                   limited, no clone for a question only git can answer)

The five checks, all of them, every call:

  1. ``open_prs``      open PRs referencing the item, FORK PRs included, with
                       ``is_cross_repository`` and author per hit, plus
                       ``untrusted_fork`` when a cross-repository PR's author
                       has no standing. That last one changes no verdict: it
                       makes the suppression LOUD, because opening a fork PR
                       needs no permission and a silent SKIP anybody can cause
                       is how an item leaves the queue with nobody told.
  2. ``merged_prs``    MERGED PRs referencing the item, each annotated
                       ``landed`` by ``git merge-base --is-ancestor`` and
                       ``closes_item`` by a closing keyword aimed at this item.
                       BOTH are load-bearing: a PR merged somewhere other than
                       the branch a worker would start from is not coverage, and
                       a PR that merely MENTIONS the item is not closure.
  3. ``prose_claim``   the body and the NEWEST human comment, scanned for
                       self-claim phrases and for closure requests — over what
                       the author SAYS, with code fences, backtick spans,
                       blockquotes and quoted spans removed first, because a
                       phrase inside them is being cited. BOTH phrase sets need
                       standing (the reporter, or a repository insider), and for
                       the SAME reason, because neither one closes anything:
                       each suppresses a dispatch, and a suppression any passer-by
                       can cast is a denial-of-work channel.
  4. ``symbol_on_base``every symbol the item names, by ``git grep`` on the
                       default branch. Absent means the target code may live
                       only on an unmerged branch — but that reading holds only
                       for a BUG-class item, so absence vetoes only when the
                       item's own metadata corroborates that class. Otherwise it
                       downgrades to ``CLAIM risk=high``: a feature request
                       names the symbol it PROPOSES to add, and parking it would
                       be a permanent false veto on a whole item class.
  5. ``recency``       age and ``authorAssociation``. A freshly opened item
                       from an active contributor is a high self-claim risk —
                       surfaced as ``risk=high``, never a veto on its own. The
                       consumer is the skill: ``risk=high`` means the item is
                       not batched, it gets a live re-check immediately before
                       the atomic claim.

Verdict precedence, first match wins (see :func:`verdict`, a pure function of
the checks dict so every branch is unit-testable with no forge access):

  1. ``merged_prs`` LANDED and CLOSES it       → CLOSE ``already-fixed``
  2. any ``open_prs`` entry                  → SKIP  ``open-pr``, marked
                                               ``untrusted-fork`` at
                                               ``risk=high`` when the PR is an
                                               unvouched fork
  3. ``prose_claim.closure_requested``       → REVIEW ``reporter-asked-close``
                                               at ``risk=high``
  4. ``prose_claim.claimed_by_other``        → SKIP  ``prose-claim``
  5. ``symbol_on_base.missing`` AND bug-class→ SKIP  ``symbol-absent``
  6. any check errored                       → UNKNOWN
  7. otherwise                               → CLAIM, annotated with ``risk``,
                                               which an UNCORROBORATED absent
                                               symbol or an UNAUTHORIZED claim
                                               forces to ``high``

Rule 3 is the one verdict here that is read out of HAND-WRITTEN ENGLISH, which is
why it is REVIEW and not CLOSE. CLOSE is the strongest response this script has,
aimed at somebody else's live work, and prose is the weakest evidence it
collects. Pairing the two is what nine separate false-CLOSE paths came out of: a
quotation bound truncated at a fixed offset, closure verbs with no object, bare
pronouns resolving to a socket rather than the item, a means-versus-state
confusion between two prepositions. Each is fixed on its merits and a ratchet
stops a new PATTERN shipping unguarded. What the ratchet cannot stop is the next
unguarded PHRASING of a pattern that is already guarded, and the space of English
that accidentally resembles "close this" has no edge to reach. So detection keeps
the job it can do, which is noticing that an item might be resolved, and does not
get the job of deciding it. Rule 1 still CLOSES, because a merged commit that is
an ancestor of the base is evidence, not prose.

Rules 2, 3 and 4 all suppress work on evidence anybody can manufacture, and all
answer it the same way rather than by refusing to look: the finding stands, and
the doubt is published alongside it. A verdict that acts while doubting has to
say so, or the doubt is only in this docstring.

Note that 6 sits BELOW the positive findings on purpose: a definite answer to
one question outranks a partial view of another, and no error path can reach
CLAIM.

Deliberately boring properties, do not weaken:

  * Forge access goes through ``gh``; no hand-rolled HTTP and no token is ever
    read by this script. ``run_gh`` refuses a mutating argv outright, so the
    no-write property is enforced rather than merely intended: this script
    never labels, assigns, comments, or closes.
  * At most one forge call per question. The timeline is fetched once and
    answers checks 1 and 2 together; each referencing PR is then detailed once,
    because fork-ness and the merge commit exist only on the pull object.
  * No user-authored PROSE reaches stdout. Failures are reported as SLUGS
    rather than forge stderr, a prose match reports the PATTERN that fired
    rather than the sentence, and a bug-class match reports this module's own
    TERM rather than the label's text — this output lands in an agent's context.
    What DOES appear is identifiers: logins, PR numbers, commit prefixes,
    comment ids and symbol names extracted from the item. Those are the evidence
    a conductor needs to check the verdict, and a login is chosen by its owner
    rather than written for this item. The claim is deliberately narrower than
    "nothing user-authored": the wider version was in this docstring first, and
    an invariant that overclaims is how a leak of user-written LABEL text once
    shipped past it.
  * A closed-unmerged PR is neither coverage nor a claim. It is abandoned work
    and it frees the item, so it appears in neither list.

    closure branch on a live item. That branch's verdict is REVIEW, so a false

    dispatch and spends a human read, while a missed one only costs the dispatch
    that discovers the work is done. The asymmetry is narrow and does not invert,

    Line structure first, then whitespace, then spans. Fences and blockquotes
    are line-shaped, so they have to go while the newlines are still there.
    Quotation marks are not, and markdown hard-wraps prose, so a quoted phrase
    routinely straddles a line break: collapsing whitespace before matching the
    spans is what makes the stripper as newline-tolerant as the ``\\s+`` in the
    phrases it defends. Without that step a body whose quote breaks mid-phrase --
    the shape this defends against -- slips through unstripped.

    Balanced spans go first, then any LEFTOVER delimiter takes the rest of the

    without the second the phrase inside it survives as the author's own words
    and withholds a live item from dispatch. Every span rule here is therefore

    body, or a repository insider by ``author_association``). One reason covers
    both, because neither reading closes anything:

    * a closure request produces REVIEW, which withholds a dispatch and asks a
      human, so "please close" from a passer-by must not fire it;
    * a self-claim produces SKIP, and a veto anyone can cast is a
      denial-of-work channel -- one comment would suppress a queued item
      indefinitely with nothing downstream reporting the suppression.

    This function is the DETECTOR and knows nothing about either verdict. What
    it reports and what is done about it are deliberately separate concerns, and
    that separation is what let the response change without the patterns moving.

    So an unauthorized claim is not discarded and not obeyed: it sets
    ``claim_without_standing``, which annotates ``risk=high`` and sends the item
    to the live recheck instead of parking it.
