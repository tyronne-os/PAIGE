"""Per-item credit spend — the deterministic half of the conductor's budget check.

Sums the credits a work item's sessions have burned, from the gateway's usage
shards, and answers "is this item inside its budget?" as data. The conductor
never estimates spend from a transcript; it reads this script's verdict.

Usage:
    python3 credit_spend.py --slots KEY[,KEY...] [--budget 100]
                            [--usage-dir PATH] [--max-shards N]

    --slots      the item's session slot keys (the current session plus any
                 retries), comma-separated
    --budget     the item's allowance in credits; omit for a plain rollup
    --usage-dir  default: <data home>/usage/tokens  (data home =
                 $KIROCREW_HOME, else ~/.kiro/crew)
    --max-shards newest daily shards scanned. Default: ALL retained shards —
                 a cost bound is opt-in, and a bounded scan that skipped older
                 shards never claims ``within`` (see verdicts)

stdout (JSON):
    {"slots": {"<key>": {"credits": 12.4, "turns": 9}},
     "total_credits": 12.4, "shards_scanned": 3, "truncated": false,
     "budget": 100.0, "remaining": 87.6, "verdict": "within"}

``verdict``: ``exhausted`` (total >= budget — monotone: more shards or missing
meters can only ADD spend, so it stands even on a partial view) | ``unmetered``
(ANY watched slot had no shard row — the caller must treat spend as unknown,
not as zero: today's shards are written by the dashboard chat runner, so a
session outside it burns invisibly) | ``truncated`` (the under-budget scan is
incomplete: older shards were skipped, a shard was unreadable, or a matched
row was corrupt — spend outside the readable view could flip the answer) |
``within`` (complete scan, every slot metered, under budget).

Exit code: 0 when the rollup ran (verdict carries the outcome); 2 on malformed
arguments. Reads only; writes nothing; no subprocess.
