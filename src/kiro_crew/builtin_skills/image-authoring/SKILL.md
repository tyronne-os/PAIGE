# Image Authoring

Create images by **authoring them as code** — there is no text-to-image model
or image-generation tool in this environment. Use when the user says
"generate/create/make an image", "draw", "illustrate", "picture of", "logo",
"icon", "poster", "banner", "mascot", "sprite", "texture", "wallpaper", or
asks to change/tune an image you made earlier.

## HARD RULES

1. **Never look for an image-generation tool.** None exists. You ARE the
   artist — author the image as code and save the file.
2. **Never present this as AI text-to-image generation.** It is authored
   graphics. For photorealism requests, explain the output is stylized
   (vector / procedural art) and offer the closest achievable style.
3. **Never recreate from scratch when the user gives feedback.** Update the
   brief, then make targeted edits to the existing source.
4. **Always keep the editable source.** SVG is its own source; for raster
   output keep the generating script/HTML next to the image so it can be
   edited and re-run.

## Workflow

### 1. Brief — summarize the context

Before authoring, compose a short brief from EVERYTHING relevant in the
conversation (earlier descriptions, project context, corrections), not just
the last message: subject, style, palette, mood, 2–3 signature details,
size/aspect, output format. Echo it in one line — "Authoring: <brief>" — so
the user can correct course before you draw.

### 2. Choose the technique

| Request | Technique |
|---|---|
| Illustration, character, logo, icon, scene, stylized art | **SVG authoring** (primary) |
| Poster, banner, card, meme, text-heavy composition | **HTML/CSS → Playwright screenshot** |
| Texture, gradient art, pixel art, noise, filters, compositing | **Python + Pillow** (raster) |
| Raster copy of an SVG (user needs .png) | Convert: rsvg-convert → inkscape → magick → Playwright screenshot |
| Flowchart, architecture, data chart | Prefer mermaid / widgets; else SVG or Pillow |
| Hand-drawn / whiteboard-style diagram, sketch aesthetic | **Excalidraw scene** — see below |

Check tool availability before relying on it (`python3 -c "import PIL"`,
`which rsvg-convert`).

### 3. Author — structured for later tuning

- Save under `<workspace>/images/` (`~/.kiro/crew/workspace/images/` by default,
  or `$KIROCREW_HOME`-relative) as `<subject>-<style>.<ext>` — this is a
  convention of this skill, so create the directory if it does not exist.
- Put the brief at the top of the source: `<!-- BRIEF: ... -->` (SVG/HTML) or
  a docstring (script). Future iterations read intent from the file itself.
- **Give every major element a stable id** so feedback can target regions:
  - SVG: `<g id="head">`, `<g id="eyes">`, `<g id="collar">`, `id="background"`
  - Pillow: one function per region (`draw_head(d)`, `draw_collar(d)`)
  - HTML: semantic ids/classes per block
- SVG quality bar: `viewBox` + `xmlns`, layered shapes, gradients,
  highlights/shadows, background scene — not minimal flat clipart.

### 4. Validate and render

- SVG/HTML: `xmllint --noout <file>` (or re-read and parse-check).
- Scripts: run them; confirm the output file exists and is non-empty.
- Show the user: `![description](/absolute/path/to/file)`.

### 5. Iterate — blend in comments

When feedback arrives ("make it darker", "bigger eyes", "add stars"):

1. Update the BRIEF comment in the source to include the new requirement —
   the file stays the single source of truth.
2. Locate the region by id and edit ONLY that region. Leave approved parts
   untouched (byte-identical) so the user's accepted details never drift.
3. Re-validate, re-render inline, and note what changed in one line.

For raster: edit the kept script/HTML and re-run — never hand-patch pixels.

### Region tuning cheat-sheet

- "the eyes / the collar / the background" → edit that `id` group only.
- "top-left / bottom / center" → map to viewBox coordinates (0,0 is top-left).
- "colors feel dull" → adjust gradient stops / palette variables only.
- "more detail on X" → add children inside X's group, keep siblings intact.
- Ambiguous region? Ask one short clarifying question instead of guessing.

## Excalidraw scenes

The dashboard renders an ```excalidraw fence (and a saved `.excalidraw` file) as
inline SVG. Reach for it when the hand-drawn whiteboard look is the point;
mermaid stays better when you want automatic layout, and a widget when you want
real HTML. Unlike mermaid, this fence is specific to this dashboard — emit it
deliberately, it is not a convention a reader will know from elsewhere.

Emit scene JSON: `{"type":"excalidraw","version":2,"elements":[…],"appState":{…}}`.
The inline fence is a **viewer, not the editor**, so author around these
differences. The composer's pencil button opens a real Excalidraw editor (Sketch
pad): when a user sketches there, the attachment arrives as a PNG plus a
`.excalidraw` JSON sidecar — read the JSON, not the pixels, since element
geometry and labels are what you can reason about. You can hand a scene back the
same way by emitting the fence. A rendered fence is click-to-enlarge in a
lightbox, so a dense diagram stays readable — do not shrink content to fit the
chat column.

- **Fonts are not bundled.** `fontFamily` 1/5/8 (the hand-drawn ids) resolve to
  whatever the *viewer's* machine aliases to CSS `cursive`, which varies per box
  and can be illegible. Use `2` (sans) or `3` (mono) unless the hand-drawn face
  matters more than legibility. Shapes stay sketchy either way — that comes from
  rough.js, not the font.
- **Bound text is approximated.** `containerId` is not resolved to its container.
  Position each text element absolutely, giving it the container's `x` and
  `width` with `textAlign: "center"` to centre a label.
- **Keep `seed` stable** across edits. rough.js derives its jitter from it, so
  new seeds make the whole diagram wobble on re-render.
- **Images** need a raster `data:image/*;base64` URL in `files`. SVG data URLs
  are rejected; `embeddable` / `iframe` elements are skipped.
- Set `appState.viewBackgroundColor` — the scene is painted on its own canvas
  rather than composited onto the chat surface, so it does not follow the theme.

Malformed JSON falls back to showing the source, so a broken scene costs the
reader the picture but never the content.

## Style hints that raise quality

- Name a concrete style: "retro comic", "neon cyberpunk", "watercolor wash",
  "flat geometric", "ukiyo-e", "vaporwave", "blueprint".
- Specify palette, background/scene, mood, and 2–3 signature details.
- For characters: distinct silhouette, expressive eyes, one accent prop.

## Multiple images

Author sequentially, or fan out with `spawn_run` (one task per image; each
task gets the full brief + exact output path).
