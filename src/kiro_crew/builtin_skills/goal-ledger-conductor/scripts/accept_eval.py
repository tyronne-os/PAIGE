"""AcceptSpec evaluator - the deterministic half of the conductor's patrol.

The conductor NEVER judges whether a work item succeeded; this script does,
and the conductor only reads its verdicts. Script-first: the decision is an
exit code and a JSON document, not a model's impression of a transcript.

Usage:
    python3 accept_eval.py < items.json

stdin (JSON):
    {"items": [
        {"id": "item-1", "accept": {"kind": "pr_checks", "pr": 123,
                                     "repo": "owner/name"}},
        {"id": "item-2", "accept": {"kind": "file", "path": "/abs/path",
                                     "exists": true}},
        {"id": "item-3", "accept": {"kind": "human_approval"}}
    ]}

stdout (JSON):
    {"results": [{"id": "...", "verdict": "pass|fail|pending|refused|error",
                  "evidence": "..."}]}

Exit code: 0 when evaluation ran (verdicts carry the outcome); 2 on malformed
input. A per-item problem is a verdict, never a crash - one bad spec must not
hide the others' results.

THE SECURITY INVARIANT (deliberate, do not weaken):

    No model-authored argv ever reaches subprocess.

A spec is written by a model, and this script runs as an approved wrapper, so a
spec that could name a command would make this script a general way to run one.
That is not a hypothetical: an earlier revision accepted a generic ``cmd`` kind
with an allowlist, and it took three review rounds to establish that no
constraint on ``argv`` fixes the shape. In order, the allowlist was defeated by
(1) bare interpreters on it, so ``python -c <payload>`` ran anything;
(2) a basename-only check, so ``/tmp/git`` executed an arbitrary binary under an
allowlisted name; and (3) plain ``git reset --hard`` - allowlisted, and
destructive. (3) is the one that settles it. Kiro Crew's denied-command floor
inspects the ``execute_bash`` command string, which here reads
``python3 .../accept_eval.py``; the real argv arrives on stdin and is executed
with ``shell=False``, so a denied command never appears in any string the hook
examines. A generic executor behind an approved wrapper therefore REMOVES the
deny floor for whatever it accepts, and the bypass is the wrapper rather than
the list - which is why the list was dropped and not tightened again.

So every argv this script runs is built HERE, from a fixed template, out of
narrowly-typed spec fields. ``_SELF_BUILT_COMMANDS`` is the internal assertion
that this stayed true: it is not a model-facing allowlist, it is a fail-closed
check that a handler did not start passing through something it was given.

HOW TO WIDEN IT (the supported path):

    Add a new ``kind`` whose handler builds its own argv. Never re-introduce a
    kind that takes a command, an argv array, or a shell string from the spec.

A ``pytest`` kind would take test paths and build ``["pytest", *paths]``; an
``npm_script`` kind would take a script name and build ``["npm", "run", name]``.
Each such addition is a deliberate, reviewable decision about one more binary,
and it keeps the invariant above intact by construction. Start narrow and add
kinds as real work items need them.

Other properties:
- No shell. argv arrays only, subprocess.run(shell=False).
- Per-check timeout (TIMEOUT_SECS). A hung check is an "error" verdict.
- Evidence is tail-capped so a chatty check cannot flood the conductor's turn.
- A ``refused`` verdict is one the conductor must surface to the user, never
  retry around.
