"""Ledger item-entry codec - the one code owner of the conductor's entry format.

The goal-conductor's only compaction-surviving state is the per-work-item entry
it writes into the session ledger's ``artifacts`` map. A format the model
re-derives from prose every patrol cycle costs two defects this codec exists to
remove: an acceptance spec that lives only in model context, so compaction loses
it, and an entry written as a nested JSON object, which the ledger rejects with
``artifacts_not_string_map`` so nothing persists at all.

This script owns the format. The conductor calls it; it never hand-rolls the
encoding.

Usage:
    python3 ledger_entry.py {encode|decode|validate|rotate} < input.json

Every mode reads one JSON document on stdin and writes one on stdout. Domain
problems (a value too long, a malformed stored entry) are structured
``{"ok": false, "error": {...}}`` results, never crashes - the conductor must
be able to read WHY and re-derive, not lose the sibling results. Exit code 0
means the operation ran; 2 means stdin was not the JSON the mode needs or the
mode name is unknown.

Modes:

``encode``  fields -> the single-line JSON STRING the ledger accepts.
    stdin:  {"accept": {...}, "session": "<key>", "round": 2,
             "status": "running", "since": "<cursor>"}
    stdout: {"ok": true, "value": "<compact json string>", "chars": 123}
    The value is a STRING (the ledger's artifacts map is string->string; a
    nested object is rejected outright). ``since`` is optional. Output is
    deterministic (sorted keys, compact separators) so rewriting an unchanged
    entry produces an identical value.

``decode``  stored value -> structured fields.
    stdin:  {"value": <the stored artifacts value>}
    stdout: {"ok": true, "entry": {...}, "terminal": bool, "complete": bool}
            or {"ok": false, "error": {"code": ..., "detail": ...}}
    ``terminal`` means the status is a finished verdict; ``complete`` means the
    entry still carries the full patrol contract (accept + session). A decode
    failure means a lost item: re-derive it from the child session, never guess.

``validate``  enforce the ledger's REAL bounds before a write is attempted.
    stdin:  {"artifacts": {"item-1": "...", ...}}   (the map about to be written)
    stdout: {"ok": bool, "violations": [{"key": ..., "code": ..., "detail": ...}]}
    The bounds mirror the ledger's own (see the constants below). Validating
    first matters because the ledger does not reject an oversized write - it
    silently TRUNCATES the value at the cap, which corrupts the JSON payload,
    and silently ages out the oldest entries past the entry cap.

``rotate``  collapse or drop terminal entries so finished items cannot age an
    ACTIVE item out of the entry cap.
    stdin:  {"artifacts": {...}}
    stdout: {"ok": true, "artifacts": {...}, "collapsed": [...], "dropped": [...]}
            or {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "cap_exceeded_all_active", ...}}
    Deterministic rule: terminal entries are first collapsed to their one-line
    outcome ({"round": N, "status": "pass"}), then - only if the map still
    exceeds the cap - dropped oldest-first. An active item is NEVER dropped;
    if the cap cannot be met without dropping one, that is a structured error
    for the conductor to surface, not a silent loss.
