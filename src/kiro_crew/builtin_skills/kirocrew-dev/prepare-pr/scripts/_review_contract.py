    (see the prompt in .github/workflows/design-review.yml) and then read that
    line back, so the 40 hex characters pass through a transcription step:

    * A >=7-hex PREFIX of the head is the ordinary form. Short-SHA references
      and the full 40 both land here, and a stamp naming an OLDER commit fails,
      which is the freshness guard the marker exists for.
    * An ELIDED head is the transcription artifact: a stamp that drops a
      CONTIGUOUS MIDDLE span and splices the head's own prefix to its own
      suffix. In one case the Design lane wrote 25 characters
      (the head's first 14 followed by its last 11) and every consumer read the
      PR as BLOCKED while PR Readiness was green.

    The elided form is verified, not merely tolerated: the token must be
    SHORTER than the head (a full-length token that is not a prefix names a
    different commit, and stays rejected), it must split into a >=7-hex prefix
    of the head plus a non-empty suffix of the head, and both halves must be
    the head's own. That keeps the guard the strict match was protecting -- a
    well-formed reference to another commit cannot pass, because it would have
    to begin with 7+ characters of THIS head and end with this head's tail --
    while a mangling of the current head does not fail closed.

    Lives here rather than once per entrypoint script: it arrived as a
    byte-identical pair pinned by a parity test, which is exactly the

    """Parse disposition comments and retain only repository writers' records.

    Permission results are cached per author without a lookup cap: a flood of
    non-writer comments cannot push a real writer's record past an artificial
    boundary that the adjudication ledger itself does not apply.

    Returns None -- the same "could not establish the record set" signal an
    unreadable comment list produces -- when any author's permission is
    INDETERMINATE. Dropping such an author instead would be unsound in one
    specific, reachable way: the ledger makes the identical lookup at review
    time, so it can have admitted a record whose later verification here fails
    transiently, and the record would then keep full downgrade power while this
    gate reported nothing to answer for. An author DEFINITIVELY below write is
    dropped as before (see author_write_verdict for why 403 counts as
    definitive).

    ``verdict`` overrides the permission lookup with a ``(repo, login) ->
    verdict`` callable. Each entrypoint passes its OWN exported
    ``author_write_verdict``, so the verdict stays the entrypoint's substitution
    seam -- the same seam ``run_command`` is for the commands underneath it.
