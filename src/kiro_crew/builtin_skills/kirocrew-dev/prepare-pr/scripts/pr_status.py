"""pr_status.py - the decisive PR-readiness gate for the prepare-pr skill.

Prints PR state + every CI check + advisory unresolved-thread count and returns
an exit code that drives the poll loop. The aggregate ``PR Readiness`` status is
authoritative when present; older PRs fall back to the full check rollup.
Stdlib only; portable.

Usage:  python3 pr_status.py [pr-number] [--readiness-context NAME]
                             [--reviewers NAME1,NAME2] [--json]
        python3 pr_status.py --disposition-gate --repo OWNER/NAME --pr N
                             --head SHA
        (no number -> auto-detect the PR for the current branch;
         --readiness-context / PREPARE_PR_READINESS_CONTEXT override the
         aggregate status-context name, default "PR Readiness";
         --reviewers / PREPARE_PR_REVIEWERS pin the reviewer fleet: only the
         named stamps are evaluated AND each named reviewer must have a fresh
         stamp; by default, every ``[<NAME>-REVIEWED]`` stamp found in bot
         comments is held to freshness, and absence is not required;
         --json appends one machine-readable object as the LAST line of stdout
         and changes nothing else -- same exit codes, same prose. Its
         ``progress_key`` sub-object is the only part safe to compare between
         runs; a monitoring loop uses it to tell a stalled PR from a moving one;
         --disposition-gate evaluates ONLY the disposition rule for an
         explicitly given repo/PR/head, prints one JSON object and exits 0 --
         this is what pr-readiness.yml calls to enforce the rule server-side,
         so the rule keeps a single definition)

Exit codes:
   0  CLEAN     - open, non-draft, MERGEABLE, no CHANGES_REQUESTED, aggregate
                  PR Readiness (or the legacy full rollup) passed, every
                  reviewer stamp matches the current head, no [BLOCK-MERGE]
                  marker for the current head, and a pull_request-event run
                  exists for the current head (when the repo uses Actions)
  10  RUNNING   - a required check is still queued/in-progress, or mergeability
                  has not been computed yet
  20  BLOCKED   - failing readiness, merge conflict, draft, CHANGES_REQUESTED,

                  a blocking review marker on the current head, no
                  pull_request-event run for the current head, a disposition
                  comment violating the one-lane / one-rationale-per-finding
                  rule, an unanswered whole-design CONCERNS verdict for the
                  current head (local loop only -- --disposition-gate and the
                  required status are unchanged), or anything that cannot be
                  confirmed

#   target  := '#123' | 'owner/repo#123' | 'https://host/owner/repo/issues/123'
#   sep     := ',' | ';' | 'and'
#
# Two properties are load-bearing.
#
# (1) The trailer must occupy the WHOLE visible line. An unanchored substring
# match also accepted prose that merely MENTIONS a past close -- "Fixed #123 in
# an earlier release; this PR only adds tests." -- and then told the author the
# keyword was fine and the NUMBER was wrong, the one reading that is never true
# for that line. A declaration is a trailer, not a mention. (Trailing
# whitespace, one sentence-ending '.'/';', a CR from a CRLF body, and a trailing
# HTML comment stay accepted, since none of them make the line prose.)
#
# (2) Qualified and URL targets are accepted. The host resolves them, so a body
# carrying one is NOT a body that forgot the verb. No reconciliation against the
# host's own repository identity is needed to accept them here: this classifier
# is only ever reached when the host resolved NOTHING, and the message it
# produces ("the verb is fine, check the reference") is correct whether the
# reference names this repository or another one.
#
# Every regex here runs against the MASKED body from
# ``_visible_markdown_prose``, never the raw one: a fenced block, an indented
# code block, an inline code span and an HTML comment are the surfaces GitHub
# itself does not resolve a closure from, and they are exactly where our own body
# template keeps its worked examples. Matching them would let a copied template
# read as a declaration the author never made.
#
# (3) INDENTATION IS CAPPED AT THREE COLUMNS, and the cap is the load-bearing
# half of that. Four columns is CommonMark's own code boundary, so this single
# bound refuses every code-indented example without the classifier needing to
# know which block type precedes it. Earlier revisions allowed any indent here
# and leaned entirely on the mask to tell code from prose, which required
# tracking whether a paragraph was open -- and that tracker was wrong for an ATX
# heading, a blockquote, a thematic break and a setext underline, each of which
# closes its block so the next indented line IS code. Enumerating block types
# converges on writing a Markdown parser; bounding the indent does not. A tab is
# refused for the same reason (it advances to the four-column stop).
#
# What the cap costs: a trailer indented four or more columns that GitHub WOULD
# resolve as lazy paragraph continuation is not credited as a declaration.
# That is the cheap direction -- it prints an advisory notice on an odd body,
# where the opposite error credits an EXAMPLE and silently suppresses a real
# unrelated-closure warning -- and a trailer is written as a whole line of its
# own, never as indented code.

# several references on one line) as missing.
# The slug is CAPTURED, not merely matched: reconciling a host closure against

# directly before the colon would turn a '#<n>' at the start of the <why> into

    Exit codes: 0 = clean, 10 = wait (nothing to do yet), 20 = act.

    Precedence is the load-bearing part, and it is ordered by "can waiting
    change this answer?" rather than by how the fields arrive:

    1. A non-open PR is terminal, and must be decided BEFORE any wait: GitHub
       reports mergeable=UNKNOWN for merged/closed PRs forever, so waiting on
       it returns 10 on every poll and a loop never stops.
    2. Conditions waiting CANNOT fix outrank "still running". A conflicted PR is
       the case that matters: the host cannot build a merge ref for it, so it
       dispatches no pull_request workflows at all and every check visible
       belongs to the old head. Ranking in-flight checks first reports "running"
       forever while nothing can complete -- a stall only a human notices.
       BEHIND, draft and CHANGES_REQUESTED behave the same way: each survives
       any amount of waiting and needs the author to act. A SETTLED reviewer
       round (``reviewer_round_settled``) joins them: once every pinned lane
       has stamped this head and one blocks, the edit is required, so the
       backend/frontend runs still in flight are spending minutes on a commit
       already condemned -- Phase 3 cancels them instead of waiting them out.
       Only the AI-review lanes gate this; a non-reviewer check still running
       does not hold the decision open, and a red one does not force it. The disposition
       evaluation (``disposition_eval``, built from disposition_violations)
       belongs here too, in BOTH its states: a violation is cleared only by
       the author editing or deleting the offending comment, and an
       UNREADABLE evaluation is not "no violations" -- while either waits
       behind an in-flight round, the reviewer bots rewrite their stamped
       comments in place, so the judged-head span mapping the verdict needs
       disappears with the old stamps. It gates because a record that claims
       several findings, another lane's finding, or no finding at all is
       exactly the blanket ruling the one-lane / one-rationale rule forbids
       -- and the adjudication ledger would consume it as written.
    3. Only then is "still running" a wait, and an uncomputed mergeability too.
    4. Everything left is a check-result verdict -- including the reviewer-side
       conditions: ``marker_eval`` (from evaluate_reviewer_markers; None skips
       the gate) and ``head_run`` (True/False/None from head_run_exists; the
       string "skip" skips the gate). Both are evaluated ONLY here, after the
       running gate: while a round is in flight the reviewer bots may simply
       not have posted yet, and a stale stamp mid-round is expected, not a
       defect. Both fail closed on "could not read".
       Advisory FINDING counts never gate -- whether a non-blocking finding
       should hold the loop open is a judgment call the exit code deliberately
       does not make.
       ``rollup_notice`` -- the non-empty NOTICE string when the rollup read
       degraded (fetch failure, or a concurrent push between the two reads) --
       never changes the exit code either, only which reason an empty rollup
       earns: a degraded read names its environment cause, so the reason (and
       ``progress_key.status``, which carries it) distinguishes an environment
       gap from a genuinely check-less PR.
       ``concerns_eval`` (from unanswered_concern_lanes; None skips the gate)
       belongs here for the same reason the marker conditions do: mid-round a
       fresh CONCERNS with no ruling yet is expected, not a defect -- the
       author has not been shown it. It gates only once the round has settled,
       which is exactly the state that would otherwise return 0 and arm auto-merge
       past an unanswered whole-design review. LOCAL ONLY: --disposition-gate
       never reaches this function, so the repository's required status keeps
       treating CONCERNS as advisory.

    of bug. Exit status is 0 for both outcomes -- the JSON carries the verdict,
    so a non-zero exit means only that this script itself failed to run, and
    the caller can tell the two apart. Enforcement scope is deliberately
    identical to the ledger's admission scope: an author the collaborators
    permission API does not confirm as a writer is DROPPED here exactly as
    codex-review.yml drops them, so this gate never blocks on a record that
    holds no downgrade power (``unverified`` counts those, for observability).
