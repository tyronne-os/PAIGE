"""``kirocrew perf`` -- debug-only performance sampling commands.

Thin CLI layer: argument handling, gate enforcement, process resolution and
output. The sampling itself lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.perf_sampler`.

Two shapes, because they answer different questions and have different
requirements:

* ``kirocrew perf sample --pid <PID>`` (default: the running gateway) attaches
  from outside via py-spy. This is the only way to see a gateway that is already
  serving, and it needs py-spy installed (plus privileges on macOS).
* ``kirocrew perf sample --call <module:callable>`` runs that callable in this
  process with the in-process sampler around it. No extra dependency, works
  everywhere, and is the path for profiling one code path in isolation.

    a stale number behind — and PIDs are reused, so attaching to a stale one would
