"""Shared reasoning-effort vocabulary for all LLM providers.

Both kiro-cli and claude-agent-acp expose a per-session "effort" (a.k.a.
thinking depth) knob, but only on reasoning-capable models — Claude
Fable/Opus/Sonnet and the recent GPT-5.x models.  This module is the single
source of truth for the valid levels and the model-capability check so the
CLI, dashboard handlers, providers, and config loader all agree.

Stdlib-only and import-light on purpose — it is imported from hot paths
(``providers/acp.py``, ``dashboard/chat_handlers.py``) and must not create
import cycles.

References:
- kiro-cli ``/effort`` (verified against 2.12/2.13 over ACP): levels
  ``low|medium|high|xhigh|max``. Available on Claude Opus/Sonnet/Fable AND the
  GPT-5.x models (``gpt-5.6-sol|terra|luna`` etc.) — kiro applies effort to any
  model that declares it, and rejects it with "Effort configuration is
  currently not available on <model>" for those that don't (deepseek, minimax,
  glm, qwen, auto). Per-model defaults live in ``~/.kiro/settings/cli.json`` →
  ``chat.modelDefaults.<model>.<key>.effort`` where ``<key>`` is
  ``output_config`` for Claude models and ``reasoning`` for GPT models.
- claude-agent-acp ``buildConfigOptions``: effort options come from each
  model's ``supportedEffortLevels``; recommended default ``xhigh`` then ``high``.
