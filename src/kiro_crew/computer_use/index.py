"""Per-session, per-app snapshot cache — the element-index lifecycle.

Element indices address a LIVE user interface, so the cache that maps an index
back to an element is a correctness control, not an optimization. Three
mechanisms bound its validity, none of which needs a turn-boundary signal
kiro-cli does not have:

1. **Hard fail, never lazy re-snapshot.** Acting on an app with no cached
   snapshot is refused. A lazy re-walk would silently let the model act on a
   tree it was never shown, which is exactly the failure indices are supposed to
   make impossible.
2. **TTL** (:data:`SNAPSHOT_TTL_SECS`). ``time.monotonic()`` throughout: a wall
   clock adjustment must never make a stale snapshot look fresh.
3. **Fingerprint drift**, checked by the caller against a FRESH walk before
   every mutating action. This module supplies the comparison; the driver
   supplies the fresh tree.

Plus :meth:`SnapshotIndex.end_turn` for an explicit early release.

**Entries are keyed by ``(session_key, window_key)``** — session, then the specific
WINDOW.

The WINDOW half: element indices address one window's accessibility tree, so keying
by application alone aliased distinct windows of the same app. Snapshot document A,
focus document B, and the follow-up action — which re-resolves to B — retrieved A's
cached tree. The fingerprint check cannot catch it, because two documents of the same
app routinely have identically-shaped toolbars, so ``role|subrole|title`` at a given
index matches and the action mutates the wrong document. ``AppRef.window_key``
carries the pid as well as the window id, since a window id is only unique within a
session and a relaunched app can reuse one.

The SESSION half. The gateway runs one
process serving every surface — dashboard tabs, Slack threads, cron jobs — so a
cache keyed by application ALONE is shared mutable state across concurrent
sessions: session A walks Preview and is shown indices, session B then walks
Preview after the UI moved and its snapshot REPLACES A's under the same key, and
A's next action resolves (and fingerprint-verifies) against B's tree. Both
sessions look internally consistent and the wrong control is activated, which is
the one outcome element addressing exists to prevent. The key is therefore
``(session_key, app_key)``, and lifecycle operations are per-session: one
session's ``computer_end_turn`` must not blow away another's live indices.

The cap is per session as well, so a chatty session cannot evict another's
entries — the eviction path would otherwise be a cross-session denial of service
that surfaces as a confusing "call computer_get_state first".

Honest limit, stated here and in the spec: fingerprinting narrows the race, it
does not eliminate it. A tree can still change between the verifying walk and
the action microseconds later. It converts a silent wrong-click into a loud
refusal in the overwhelming majority of cases; it is not a transactional
guarantee. Namespacing removes the CROSS-SESSION race entirely (two sessions cannot
share an entry); it does not remove the within-session one, which is
inherent to driving a live UI.

Pure: no ctypes, no I/O, no platform calls.

    Thread-safe: the MCP stdio loop dispatches tool calls on a worker thread

    sessions' calls on a thread pool — so every mutation is under one lock.

    Every accessor takes the ``session_key`` explicitly rather than reading an
    ambient value. The dispatcher already carries that identity (it is the same
    key the authoritative gate is queried with), and a thread-local would be
    wrong here: the gateway runs each dispatch on a POOLED thread, so a
