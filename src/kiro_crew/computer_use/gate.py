"""The computer-use enable check, and the audit of what it allowed.

Deliberately small. An earlier revision of this module carried a full governance
model for computer use — eight ``SCOPE_CATALOG`` rows (capability, actions, apps,
app_names, observations, targets, approval, pointer), an unattended-surface
refusal, an interactive-approval floor, and a per-app disclosure filter. All of it
is gone: the product decision is that computer use is one operator opt-in, and
after that the agent drives the desktop the way the operator would.

What remains here is the one question worth asking on every call — *is the feature
on?* — plus the SEL audit trail, so the operator has a record of what the agent did
to their desktop.

Where the real protections live now, none of which is in this file:

* the **primary enable** is on the keystone ``computer_use.json``
  (``enable_state``), which ``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` fences the agent away
  from. That is what keeps "the agent cannot turn on its own desktop automation"
  true, and it is checked at the dispatch chokepoint in :mod:`tools`;
* **KiroCrew's own window** is refused by :mod:`policy`, because driving our own
  Settings UI would route around the keystone above;
* **password fields** are never read and never photographed (``ElementRec.secure``
  → the renderer emits a placeholder, and a window holding one gets no screenshot
  at all). That is a privacy floor, not a policy knob;
* **credential redaction** on the way out is the repo-wide control every other
  egress path already runs.

Nothing here touches ctypes, the filesystem, or a platform framework, so this
module imports and tests identically on macOS, Linux, Windows and in CI.
