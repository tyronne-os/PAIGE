"""The Windows UI Automation tree walk: one window into an indexed element tree.

The counterpart of :mod:`snapshot_macos`. Everything platform-specific about
*reaching* the tree lives in :mod:`windows_ffi`; this module owns the shape of
the result — which nodes get an index, what a role is called, and which of the
walk's own limits have to be reported to the caller.

Three properties are inherited from the macOS walk because the layers above
depend on them, not because they are stylistic:

* **The walk is ITERATIVE.** A pathological tree must not ``RecursionError``
  inside a ctypes call, where the failure is not a clean Python exception.
* **Indices are DENSE.** Structural containers that carry no information of their
  own are dropped WITHOUT consuming an index, so the numbering a model addresses
  stays compact. ``index.resolve`` looks a record up by its ``index`` field
  rather than by list position, so the two are not interchangeable.
* **A cut-off walk says so.** ``truncated`` / ``depth_truncated`` are not
  diagnostics: the capture gate refuses a screenshot when either is set, because
  a walk that silently dropped a subtree would let the secure-field scan reflect
  only the nodes it reached — and a password field past the cut would get the
  whole window photographed.

Frames are WINDOW-LOCAL, with ``Snapshot.window_bounds`` publishing the origin
they are relative to. UIA reports a screen rectangle, so this module subtracts
the window origin: a screen-absolute rect could not be related to the screenshot
the model may also be reading (which is a crop of the window), and a
window-local frame survives the user dragging the window between turns.

    the text go nowhere. Settability is the only signal that separates them.

    But the read is GATED on a text-bearing role. A cached ``ValueIsReadOnly`` read
    folds "this provider does not implement ValuePattern" into its default of
    ``False`` — the same default hazard the secure read avoids with the ``Ex``
    form — so a ``TitleBar`` or a ``Button`` reads as ``editable`` and a model
    wastes a turn on ``computer_type_text``. Restricting the trait to roles that
    actually accept typed input turns that false positive off, and the role is
    already the module's authority for every other value-sensitive decision.

    ``selected`` comes from ``SelectionItem.IsSelected``, NOT from

    the element holding the caret.

    ``expanded`` comes from ``ExpandCollapseState``, the counterpart of the macOS

    from a closed one and spends a turn expanding something already open. Only an

    the numbering that produced index 7. This walks with the caller's own budget for
    exactly that reason: a different budget yields a different numbering, so element
    7 would be a different control.

    The index is matched by **re-deriving the same elision and numbering rules**
    :func:`build_snapshot` applies, rather than by list position. A structural
    wrapper is dropped WITHOUT consuming an index there, so position and index are
    not interchangeable and indexing the raw walk would address the wrong node.

    Yields ``None`` when the tree has no such index — the drift check upstream
    normally catches this first, but a UI can change between the check and the
    action, and yielding ``None`` makes that a clean refusal rather than an
    IndexError inside a ctypes call.

    The role AND the name are re-derived and compared. Both are needed, and the
    reason is data loss rather than tidiness: a toolbar that swapped Save for Delete
    leaves both as ``Button`` at the same index, so a role-only check accepts Delete
    and the action presses it. The name is what separates them, and it is already
