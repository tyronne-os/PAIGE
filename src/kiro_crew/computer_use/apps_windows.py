"""Windows application enumeration, identity, and the confinement predicate.

The Windows counterpart of :mod:`apps_macos`, and it diverges from it in one
structural way that is worth stating before the code: **on Windows a pid is not
an application identity.**

``apps_macos`` can key everything on the pid because macOS delivers synthesized
input per-process (``CGEventPostToPid``), so "this pid is authorized" and "this
app is authorized" are the same statement. Windows has no per-process input
delivery at all, and worse, one broker process fronts many unrelated
applications: ``ApplicationFrameHost.exe`` was measured here hosting *Settings*
and *HP Audio Control* at the same time under a single pid. Keying identity or
confinement on the pid would therefore let the agent be authorized for one app
and act on another — exactly the failure the confinement check exists to prevent.

So everything here keys on the **top-level HWND**, and the pid is carried only as
a secondary, non-sufficient signal. ``AppRef.window_id`` holds that handle, which
is also what makes ``AppRef.window_key`` (app identity plus pid plus window id)
correctly distinguish two windows of the same application.

Nothing in this module imports ctypes: all native work goes through
:mod:`windows_ffi`.

    A NON-raising counterpart to :func:`resolve_app`, for the launch verb's two
    questions — "is it already running?" before spawning, and "has it appeared yet?"
    while polling. Both are ordinary-negative: not-running is the case a launch
    exists to fix, so an exception would make the normal path the error path.

    Matched on the executable STEM first, and that is what makes it usable for a
    launch: the catalog names an executable (``mspaint.exe``) while a freshly-launched
    window's title is whatever document it opened (``Untitled - Paint``), so a
    title-only match would miss the window we just started.

    **A HOSTED window needs the title too**, and the reason is a deliberate decision
    made elsewhere in this module: :func:`_app_ref` replaces BOTH ``name`` and
    ``bundle_id`` with the window title for a window fronted by
    ``ApplicationFrameHost``, because the host's image name identifies no application
    (see :data:`_WINDOW_HOST_PROCESSES`). So for a packaged app the executable stem the
    catalog resolved and the identity this module publishes never agree, and a stem-only
    lookup answers ``None`` for a window that is plainly on screen. Both of the launch
    verb's questions then answer wrongly: the already-running pre-check does not fire,
    so the model gets a SECOND copy, and the post-launch poll burns its whole timeout
    and reports "no window appeared" for an app that opened one.

    The title match is a SUBSTRING and is tried only after the exact forms, so an exact
    stem still wins — the ordering :func:`resolve_app` uses, for the reason it gives
    there: without it, asking for ``chrome`` could resolve to a window whose title merely
    contains the word.

    An enumeration failure resolves to ``None`` rather than propagating: during a
    launch poll a transient failure is indistinguishable from "not there yet", and
    the poll's own timeout is the bound.
