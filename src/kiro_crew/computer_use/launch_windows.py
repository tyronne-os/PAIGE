"""Windows application launching: an OS catalog, verified against protected roots.

``computer_launch_app`` is the only verb in this package that starts a PROCESS, so
its target resolution is the narrowest thing here. This module answers one question
— "which installed application does this name mean, and may we run it?" — and the
shape of the answer is set by four measurements on Windows 11, all of which say the
obvious approach is unsafe:

* **``HKCU\\…\\App Paths`` is writable by the same unprivileged user the agent runs
  as.** Verified by creating a key and pointing it at another binary.
* **``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps`` is on ``PATH`` and writable**, and it
  is what ``shutil.which("mspaint")`` resolves to. So a ``PATH`` lookup resolves the
  drawing app through a directory the agent can plant a binary in.
* **The per-user Start Menu is writable too**, so a ``.lnk`` there is agent-authored
  input, not an OS statement.
* **No fully-protected source enumerates a packaged app's AUMID.**
  ``C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps`` is protected but *not listable*
  (``os.listdir`` → ``WinError 5``), the machine-wide
  ``Windows.Launch\\PackageId`` key holds only system components, and the
  ``StateRepository`` database is unreadable. Paint — the canonical drawing target
  — is a packaged app, so a "trusted catalog only" design cannot reach it at all.

**So the catalog is untrusted INPUT and the verified target is the guarantee.**
:func:`installed_apps` reads every catalog it can, including the writable ones, and
:func:`resolve_target` then refuses anything whose executable does not sit under a
root this user cannot write. That is the same shape ``platform_compat.
trusted_system_bin`` uses — ignore the search path, verify the candidate's
directory — widened from two system directories to the protected install roots,
because an application is not a system binary and does not live in ``System32``.

Three properties make that verification hold rather than merely look strict:

* **``os.path.realpath`` before the prefix test.** A junction is resolved, so a link
  under a writable directory cannot borrow a protected prefix. The reverse — a
  junction *under* a protected root aimed at agent-writable content — was attempted
  and refused by the OS (``mklink /J`` under ``C:\\Program Files`` → "Access is
  denied"), which is what makes the prefix test meaningful in both directions.
* **The basename must match the catalog key.** An agent that rewrites an ``App
  Paths`` value can then only aim it at a file that already exists under a protected
  root *and* is named what the key claims, which reduces the rewrite to "run an app
  that is already installed under its own name". Measured against every real entry
  on this host: 46 of 47 resolvable entries satisfy it, the one exception being a
  deliberate Microsoft alias (``IEDIAG.EXE`` → ``IEDIAGCMD.EXE``), which is refused
  rather than special-cased.
* **No arguments, ever.** The launch argv is exactly ``[executable]``. A document
  path or a URL would make this verb a way to hand attacker-chosen input to an
  arbitrary installed application, which is a different capability from "open the
  drawing app".

Window confirmation is :mod:`apps_windows`' job. The one native call here is the file-owner
lookup in :func:`_owned_by_current_user`, and like ``winreg`` its ``ctypes`` import is
deferred into the function so this module still imports on a Linux CI runner.

**``winreg`` is imported inside the function that uses it**, not at module scope, and
that is required rather than tidy: the module does not exist on Linux or macOS, so a
module-scope import would raise ``ImportError`` there — breaking
``test_every_module_imports_on_any_platform`` and, worse, the collection of every test
that transitively touches ``kiro_crew`` on the CI fleet. It is the same rule the
sibling modules follow for their native libraries, applied to a stdlib module that
happens to be platform-specific.

    2. **its own containing directory is not writable by this user**, tested by
       attempting to create a file there.

    A prefix test alone is not sufficient, and the reason is measured rather than
    theoretical: an unwritable root can contain writable DESCENDANTS. On this host
    ``C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\color`` and
    ``C:\\Windows\\System32\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\MachineKeys`` are both writable by

    one. (``C:\\Windows`` is worse still — ``Temp``, ``Tasks`` and the same colour

    ``realpath`` FIRST, and that is load-bearing too: a junction under a writable

    and it runs at most once per launch, on a path already known to be under a protected

    on the file itself. So a parent that refuses creates can still hold an executable this
    user rewrites with ``open(path, "r+b")`` — measured — and the protected-root test alone
    accepted it. The macOS sibling makes the same distinction
    (``launch_macos._any_executable_is_writable``); a target has to fail BOTH questions to be
    trusted, on either platform.

    **``os.open(.., O_RDWR)``, not ``os.access(.., W_OK)``.** On Windows ``os.access`` reports
    the read-only ATTRIBUTE and never consults the ACL, so it answers True for every file
    that is not flagged read-only — including every binary in ``System32``, which would make
    this refuse the whole catalog. Measured from an unelevated shell: ``os.access`` says
    writable for ``System32\\notepad.exe`` while opening it for write is denied. Opening
    ``O_RDWR`` asks the real question, and it modifies nothing: no ``O_TRUNC``, no write, the
    handle is closed immediately. That matters because this runs on a binary the launch is
    about to ALLOW and must not damage a real installed application.

    **OWNERSHIP is checked first, and it is the decisive half.** A current write denial is not
    durable: the OWNER of a Windows object holds ``WRITE_DAC`` implicitly, so an agent that
    plants a binary and then denies itself write can revoke that deny ACE again with no
    privilege. Measured — ``icacls <file> /deny <me>:(WD)`` makes the open fail and
    ``icacls <file> /remove:d <me>`` makes it succeed again, both as an ordinary user. So a
    file this user OWNS counts as replaceable whatever its ACL currently says, exactly as
    ``launch_macos._file_is_replaceable`` treats ``st_uid``. That still admits the real
    catalog: on the measured host ``System32`` binaries are owned by
    ``NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller`` and ``Program Files`` content by ``SYSTEM``.

    Fails CLOSED on anything other than the denial that means "no": a file that cannot be
    examined counts as replaceable, so an unverifiable target is refused rather than run.

    The one function that decides what may run, applying four checks in the order

    1. **the QUERY must not name a command interpreter.** Checked before resolution
       and separately from check 3, because those two catch different things — see
       below;
    2. **the catalog must name it** — an exact key or stem match, then a unique
       PREFIX match. A prefix hitting several applications RAISES rather than picking
       one, because launching the wrong application is not undoable;
    3. **the resolved executable must not be a command interpreter** (see
       :data:`_REFUSED_EXECUTABLES` for why that is a narrow guard rather than the
       boundary);
    4. **the executable must sit under a protected root AND be named after the key
       that found it.** This is the boundary. Together the two conditions mean an
       agent that rewrites its own writable catalog entry can still only start an
       application that is already installed system-wide under that same name.

    **Checks 1 and 3 are both needed, and a live run is what proved it.** Check 3
    inspects what the name RESOLVED to, so it cannot see a request for a shell whose
    name resolves elsewhere: asking for ``cmd`` on the measured host matched the
    unrelated ``IEDIAGCMD.EXE`` (an Internet Explorer diagnostic) and LAUNCHED it,
    passing every other check on the way. Check 1 refuses the request by what it
    asked for; check 3 refuses it by what it would run.

    **The fuzzy tier is a PREFIX rather than a substring, for the same reason.** A
    3-character fragment matching inside a 9-character name is a coincidence, not an
    intent — and the ambiguity guard cannot help, because a coincidence usually hits
    exactly one entry. A prefix is what someone typing the beginning of a name
    produces. Where that is too strict the refusal carries the near misses, so a
    model that typed ``paint`` is told about ``mspaint`` rather than being left to
    guess.

      terminal would take the operator's application down with the gateway.
