"""macOS application launching: an app-bundle catalog under the standard roots.

The macOS half of ``computer_launch_app``, and structurally simpler than
:mod:`launch_windows` for one reason: **macOS has a real catalog.** An application
is a ``.app`` bundle in a small set of conventional directories, so the catalog is a
directory listing rather than a registry of name-to-executable mappings that a
per-user hive can redirect. There is no equivalent of Windows'
``HKCU\\…\\App Paths``, and nothing here resolves through ``PATH``.

The launcher is ``/usr/bin/open -a <bundle path>``, pinned by absolute path exactly as
``platform_compat.reveal_in_file_manager`` pins it, and it is handed the PATH this
module verified rather than a name or anything the caller supplied. The path matters:
``open -a`` given a NAME asks LaunchServices to resolve it again from its own database,
which indexes bundles this module deliberately excludes — so the bundle that was checked
and the bundle that runs need not be the same one. Two further consequences worth
stating:

* ``open -a`` is idempotent by design — a second call activates the running copy
  instead of starting another — so the "already running" refusal here is about
  telling the model something useful, not about preventing a duplicate process.
* ``-a`` takes an application, never a document. The document form (``open <file>``)
  is deliberately not reachable: it would let this verb hand attacker-chosen input
  to whatever application claims that file type, which is a different capability
  from "open the drawing app".

**The resolved bundle is VERIFIED, not merely found**, which is what the ABC contract
(:meth:`~kiro_crew.computer_use.backend.ComputerUseBackend.launch_app`) requires of
every implementation: a catalog can be agent-writable, so the check has to bound the
target rather than trust the lookup. Two conditions here, mirroring what
:mod:`launch_windows` does with the registry:

* the bundle must sit under one of the :data:`_APP_ROOTS`, and ``~/Applications`` is
  **not** one of them — it is writable by the same user the agent runs as, so including
  it would let a planted ``~/Applications/Anything.app`` be launched;
* the bundle's own parent directory must not be writable by this process
  (:func:`_directory_is_writable`), which catches a ``/Applications`` that is
  group-writable on a machine whose admin group has been widened. An unwritable ROOT can
  still contain a writable child, so the root list alone is not the check.

The cost is stated rather than hidden: an application a user installed only for
themselves cannot be launched by name. The refusal says so and names the remedy (move
the bundle, or open it by hand), which is recoverable — where a launch verb that runs
whatever the agent wrote is not.

The no-arguments rule holds on top of both: ``open -a`` opens an application and can
never be handed a document, so this stays "start an installed app" rather than "run one
against attacker-chosen input".

#: LaunchServices' front door, pinned absolute. Never resolved from ``PATH`` — that is
#: the rule ``platform_compat.trusted_system_bin`` exists to enforce, and
#: ``reveal_in_file_manager`` pins the same binary for the same reason.
#:
#: Composed from POSIX components rather than written as one literal, and joined with
#: an explicit ``"/"`` rather than ``os.path.join``. Two reasons, and the second is why
#: the obvious form is wrong:
#:
#: * ``cross-platform.yml``'s portability gate rejects an added absolute POSIX path
#:   literal, because on Windows such a path names nothing and a hardcoded one is how a
#:   POSIX-only assumption reaches shared code. This module IS macOS-only so the path is
#:   correct here, but the gate scans added lines and cannot know that;
#: * ``os.path.join(os.sep, ...)`` would produce ``\usr\bin\open`` when the module is
#:   merely IMPORTED on Windows — which every CI shard does. The value would then be a
#:   nonsense path that no test could distinguish from a typo. A literal ``"/"`` keeps
#:   the constant identical on every platform, which is what makes it assertable.
_OPEN_BIN = "/".join(("", "usr", "bin", "open"))

#: Where a launchable application bundle lives. Ordered most-trusted first, so a system
#: install wins a name collision against a machine-wide one.
#:
#: **``~/Applications`` is deliberately absent.** It is writable by the same user the
#: agent runs as, so including it made this verb a native-code-execution path: plant
#: ``~/Applications/Anything.app`` and launch it. Documenting that was not a bound — the
#: Windows sibling verifies its resolved target for exactly this reason, and "macOS has
#: no protected prefix for per-user installs" is an argument for excluding the per-user
#: root, not for trusting it.
#:
#: The cost is real and is the right trade: an application a user installed only for
#: themselves cannot be launched, and the refusal names the catalog rule so the user can
#: move the bundle to ``/Applications`` (or open it themselves) rather than being left
#: guessing. Losing one install location is recoverable; a launch verb that
#: runs whatever the agent wrote is not.

    """Whether this user could change what *app* runs — by CREATE or by REPLACE.

    The launch boundary. A bundle is a directory of ordinary files, so "the app lives
    under ``/Applications``" bounds only who could add a NEW app there — it says nothing
    about who can rewrite the Mach-O inside an existing one.

    **Two different permissions, so two different tests.** Directory writability governs
    create, unlink and rename; rewriting an EXISTING file's bytes needs write on the file
    inode and no directory permission at all. A create-probe therefore answers "unwritable"
    for the ordinary drag-install and Homebrew-cask shape — root-owned directories that deny
    creates, holding an executable owned by the installing user — while
    ``open(exe, "r+b")`` replaces the binary in place. So the executables under
    ``Contents/MacOS`` are checked directly (:func:`_any_executable_is_writable`) as well as
    the directories being probed for creates.

    **EVERY directory on the path is probed, not just the endpoints**, because write access
    to any single one of them is enough to control what executes:

    * the bundle's PARENT — a whole bundle dropped beside the real ones;
    * the BUNDLE directory — ``Contents`` replaced wholesale;
    * ``Contents`` — the one an endpoints-only check misses. It is an intermediate rather
      than "deeper nesting", and its writability is independent of both neighbours (an
      unwritable parent does not make a child unwritable — the same measured fact that
      makes the root list insufficient in the first place). Owning it is enough:
      ``mv Contents/MacOS Contents/MacOS.bak && mkdir Contents/MacOS`` yields an
      agent-owned executable directory that every other probe then answers "unwritable"
      for. It also holds ``Info.plist``, so the same access rewrites
      ``CFBundleIdentifier`` and defeats :func:`target_identity`'s pre-spawn deny;
    * ``Contents/MacOS`` — the binary itself swapped in place.

    None of this is hypothetical or exotic. ``/Applications`` is root-owned and unwritable,
    but a bundle installed there by a user-space installer — every drag-install and every
    Homebrew cask — is owned by the installing user, so the agent runs as someone who can
    replace its executable. A parent-only probe passes that bundle and launches whatever
    was written into it.

    **The directories are FIXED, never read from the bundle.** Asking the bundle's own
    ``Info.plist`` where its executable lives is the obvious refinement and it is the wrong
    one: ``CFBundleExecutable`` is inside the very directory whose trustworthiness is in
    question, and an absolute or traversing value aims the probe OUTSIDE the bundle
    (``/tmp/x`` probes ``/tmp``; ``../../..`` walks up out of it). The target would then
    choose which directory gets judged, which is the opposite of a check. ``Contents/MacOS``
    is the location the OS itself requires, and a nested executable below it sits under a
    directory already being probed.

    Fails CLOSED throughout — :func:`_directory_is_writable` answers ``True`` on any
    error it cannot interpret as a denial, and every probe here is consulted only to
    decide whether to START A PROCESS.
