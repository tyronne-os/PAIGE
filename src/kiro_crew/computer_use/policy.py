"""Target/input policy and egress redaction for computer use.

Pure decision logic — no ctypes, no I/O, no platform calls. Every function here
is a *deny* gate: it either returns ``None`` (nothing to say) or a refusal
sentence. Nothing in this module can widen access.

Why this module carries so much weight: computer use is structurally invisible
to every other security plane in KiroCrew. ``is_sensitive_path`` cannot see a
password field's ``AXValue``; the bash deny rules cannot see a keystroke posted
into a terminal window; the exfil URL scan cannot see a logged-in banking tab
rendered as pixels. The path matchers protect the filesystem the agent reaches
through *tools*; this module is the only thing standing between the agent and
the same data reached through *the operator's own windows*.
