"""macOS TCC permission probing — **ADVISORY ONLY, NEVER A GATE**.

This module exists to put a helpful hint in the Settings panel. It must never
decide whether an action proceeds, and no caller may treat a ``missing`` result as
"unavailable". That is not caution, it is a reproduced fact: during live probing
**both** grants reported ``missing`` while a full-fidelity window capture and a
complete accessibility tree came back successfully.

The reason is how macOS attributes a TCC grant. The grant follows the
**responsible parent** of the process tree, not the process that asks. The
gateway spawns kiro-cli, which spawns the MCP sidecar, so the grant belongs to
whatever launched the tree — ``KiroCrew.app`` when packaged, ``Terminal.app`` for a
dev ``kirocrew gateway``, an IDE if launched from one. A probe inspects only its
own process's grant and therefore reports ``missing`` for a tree that is fully
authorized. :attr:`PermissionProbe.responsible_hint` names the process the user
should actually grant, because "grant Accessibility to KiroCrew" is unactionable
advice when the thing holding the grant is their terminal.

Two related hazards this module is careful about:

* ``CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess`` is **never** called and is not even bound in
  :mod:`macos_ffi`. It pops a system dialog from the calling process, which from a
  background sidecar is an unexplained prompt the operator cannot attribute to
  anything they did. Only the ``Preflight`` variant is used.
* Ad-hoc re-signing anything in the process chain **voids an existing grant**
  (observed permanently breaking Accessibility 3/3 times on a re-signed bundle).
  ``packaging/resign-macos-libs.sh`` re-signs native libs, so a user whose
  permissions "worked yesterday" may have been broken by an update rather than by
  a setting. The hint text has to leave room for that.
