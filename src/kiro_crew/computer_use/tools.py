"""The eleven computer-use tools and the single in-gateway dispatch chokepoint.

**Everything in this module runs in the GATEWAY process**, never in the stdio MCP
sidecar. :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_computer` is a thin shim that resolves the caller's
identity strictly and forwards over loopback; all authorization, all accessibility
and capture work, and all audit happen here. That split is not stylistic:

* ``hooks._governance_denial`` — the PreToolUse gate — is fail-**OPEN** by
  deliberate repo policy, because it gates every tool call on every surface and a
  transient profile-store glitch must not wedge the product. Nothing in this
  module relies on it: it can be skipped entirely (a pre-authorized tool, a
  fail-open evaluation) without weakening anything below.
* The refusals that DO hold for computer use are enforced HERE, in band, on the
  dispatch path every caller goes through — the keystone enable, the
  KiroCrew's-own-window denylist, the secure-field and sensitive-text checks. They
  only work where the OS-resolved app identity and the addressed element's role are
  known, i.e. in this process.

**Ordering inside :func:`_dispatch` is a security property.** Read it as:

1. the keystone primary enable (a refusal that can only deny, and the cheapest —
   a disabled feature must not even enumerate the operator's windows);
2. OS identity resolution — the on-screen window list ONLY. The audit record's
   ``app_bundle_id`` / ``app_display_name`` MUST be what the driver resolved, never
   the agent's ``app`` argument, so this precedes step 5. No accessibility tree is
   walked and no pixels are captured in this step;
3. the cached element lookup — an in-memory read of a tree the model was already
   shown. Its own refusals ("call computer_get_state first") are DEFERRED until
   after step 5 so nothing is disclosed before the target policy has run;
3d. the pointer-request shape — one-of(``element_index`` | ``x``+``y``), the
   method/target match and the button enum, resolved into a frozen request whose
   ``click_method`` is CONCRETE. ``auto`` is resolved HERE, upstream of the driver,
   and **never** onto the pointer-moving method: the model must NAME ``global`` for
   the operator's cursor to move at all;
4. ``gate.require_computer_use`` — now audit-only, and unconditionally permits.
   Retained as the one place a future edition can reintroduce a decision without
   touching every call site; see :mod:`gate`;
4b. ``gate.require_pointer_move`` — reached only when the resolved method actually
   warps the operator's physical cursor. Also permits by default; an
   ``accessibility`` or ``app_post`` click never reaches it at all;
5. **the always-on target policy (``policy.check_app``) — the real refusal.** The
   built-in denylist floor, which an operator's allow-list can narrow but never
   widen. This is what stops the agent driving Kiro Crew's own window.
   ``computer_launch_app`` is the one verb whose target is not resolved in step 2 —
   it has no window yet, which is the point of it — so it runs the SAME
   ``check_app`` inside its own branch, against an ``AppRef`` synthesized from the
   requested name, BEFORE creating a process. It must be ``check_app`` and not the
   built-in floor alone: the spawn is detached, so a refusal afterwards does not
   un-launch anything, and calling only the floor exempted the operator's own
   ``extra_denied_apps`` / ``allowed_apps`` from the only verb that starts programs;
6. the deferred snapshot-freshness refusal (TTL / missing state);
7. fingerprint drift verification against a fresh walk;
8. the input-target policy (secure-field refusal + the sensitive-text scan);
9. the driver call;
10. the post-action re-walk;
11. ``gate.apply_observation_ceiling`` + ``policy.redact_result`` on the way out.

**Step 11 applies to REFUSALS too, not only to results.** A refusal is prose about
the operator's desktop: a fingerprint-drift message names the element that moved
(its verbatim accessibility title), a driver failure names the action that failed,
a denied-app refusal names the resolved bundle id. Surfacing any of those verbatim
would make the one path that skips the egress pass the easiest way to read a token
out of a status bar. :func:`_refusal` is therefore the single exit for every
model-facing refusal string, and it applies the SAME two controls in the same
order. Refusals that are 100% this package's own static prose (the primary-enable
refusal, the generic governance denials, the "pass an element_index" hint) are
excluded by construction — they carry no desktop text, and running them through
redaction could only mangle the instruction the model needs.

**No blocking call touches the event loop.** :func:`dispatch_tool` is deliberately
SYNCHRONOUS and blocking (accessibility round-trips to another process, an
in-process JPEG encode, one keystone file read), and it is the caller's job to keep
it off the loop:

* the gateway handler (``dashboard/handlers/computer_use.py``) offloads it once per
  request, so one tool call costs exactly ONE thread hop rather than one per
  native step;
* an async caller with no offload machinery of its own uses :func:`dispatch`,
  which offloads onto ``subprocess_executor()`` — the same bounded pool the repo
  reserves for calls that can block on a wedged kernel resource, which is exactly
  what a hung target application is.

Verified safe under concurrency: four simultaneous accessibility walks on worker
threads kept the loop responsive for 40/40 heartbeat ticks, because ctypes
releases the GIL around the C call.

Every result is TEXT ONLY. ``validation.build_tool_response`` is the transport's
single exit and cannot express an image content block, so "tree first, relay the
screenshot as a path" is a property of the transport rather than a policy someone
can regress.

    Also the single place a PRE-GATE refusal is audited. The gate
    audits its own denials and ``_audit_allowed`` records permitted calls, which left
    a hole between them: a schema ``ValidationError``, an unknown tool, a bad
    ``click_method``, a stale index, an unparseable key or the paste refusal all
    return through here WITHOUT ever reaching the gate, so nothing was recorded. An
    audit trail with a gap at "malformed or refused attempts" is the wrong shape for
    this surface — a burst of them is exactly the signal an investigation wants.

    ``tool_name`` is optional only because a handful of call sites refuse before the
    tool name is known to be meaningful; when it is empty the event still records the
    surface and the outcome.

    Refusal prose is not exempt from egress control just because the call failed.
    ``StaleIndex`` from a fingerprint drift embeds ``render.describe_record`` for
    BOTH the cached and the fresh element, i.e. two verbatim accessibility titles;
    a ``ComputerUseError`` from the driver quotes the app label; a
    ``ValidationError`` echoes an argument. So this applies the same two controls
    :func:`_render_snapshot` applies, in the same order:

    1. **the observation ceiling** — a policy that denies ``element_values`` or
       ``file_paths`` must not be readable around by provoking a drift, so the
       refusal's text is put THROUGH ``apply_observation_ceiling`` as the
       ``PAYLOAD_TEXT`` field (the channel ``_scrub_paths`` already understands),
       and the element-values deny — which has no per-field meaning in a flat
       sentence — drops the desktop detail entirely in favour of the ordinary
       "call ``computer_get_state`` again" instruction. Dropping rather than
       narrowing is the honest reading: a drift message IS an element value.
    2. **the redaction pass** — ``policy.redact_result``, the same call every
       renderer in :mod:`render` ends with.

    The ceiling's suppression notes are deliberately NOT appended here: a refusal
    is one sentence the model must act on, and "screenshot suppressed" alongside
    "call get_state again" would only be noise (nothing in a refusal carries
    pixels or a tree in the first place).

    Fail-closed on a ceiling that cannot be evaluated: ``permitted_observation_
    channels`` already returns the empty set on an error, which lands on the
    detail-dropping branch below.
