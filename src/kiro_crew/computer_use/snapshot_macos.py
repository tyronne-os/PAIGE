"""The accessibility walk: one application window into an indexed element list.

Two things here carry real weight.

**The walk is ITERATIVE, with an explicit stack.** Not a style choice. A recursive
walk over a pathological tree raises ``RecursionError``, and Python's recursion
guard is not reliable when the frames in question are interleaved with ctypes
calls into another process's accessibility server — the failure mode there is a C
stack overflow, which is a hard crash rather than an exception. An explicit stack
makes depth a data bound instead of a stack bound.

**``secure`` is derived from BOTH ``AXRole`` and ``AXSubrole``.** A real macOS
password box reports ``AXRole='AXTextField'`` — completely innocuous — with
``AXSubrole='AXSecureTextField'`` and a **readable** ``AXValue``. A role-only
check therefore misses EVERY password field, and three separate protections key
off this one flag: value redaction in the renderer, input refusal in
:mod:`policy`, and whole-window screenshot suppression. Getting it wrong defeats
all three at once, which is why the derivation lives in one function
(:func:`_is_secure`) that a test pins directly.

Electron/Chromium apps (Slack, VS Code, Obsidian, and KiroCrew's own desktop app)
need ``AXManualAccessibility`` before they expose anything useful, and the symptom
has two shapes — both reproduced live:

* a hard ``kAXErrorCannotComplete`` (-25204) for every attribute read (Chrome);
* a *successful* read that returns a 13-node stub (Obsidian, before the opt-in;
  574 nodes after it).

So the retry triggers on either an error OR an implausibly small tree, which is
the only way to catch the second shape.

    Each candidate window's bounds are re-read for ITS walk rather than inherited
    from the caller: a poll can select a different window (the app finished opening
    its real one), and frames measured against the previous window's origin would be
    offset by the distance between the two — plausible-looking numbers pointing at
    the wrong place.

    """Flatten a window's accessibility subtree into indexed records.

    **The single numbering authority.** Both the snapshot path and the driver's
    element-addressing re-walk call this one function, because two
    implementations of "which node is index 7" that drifted apart would be a
    silent wrong-target bug — the worst class this feature can produce.

    **Iterative** — an explicit ``(element, depth)`` stack, never recursion. A
    recursive walk of a deep tree overflows the C stack from inside a ctypes call
    chain, and that is a process abort rather than a ``RecursionError`` something
    could catch.

    Pre-order with children pushed in reverse, so pop order is left-to-right and
    the indices the model sees match the order the renderer prints them.

    Three budgets, reported separately because they mean different things to a
    model: ``truncated`` says "there is more of this tree", ``depth_truncated``
    says "there is more BELOW what you can see", and ``time_truncated`` says "this
    app was too slow to finish".

    **The time budget is not redundant with the node budget.**
    ``AX_MESSAGING_TIMEOUT_SECS`` bounds ONE accessibility call, not a walk: this
    loop makes ~5 AX calls per node over up to :data:`MAX_TREE_NODES_LIMIT` nodes,
    so an app whose reads each take the full per-call timeout would park a worker
    thread for tens of minutes without ever exceeding a single timeout. The node
    and depth budgets do not help — they bound work, not time. Only the aggregate
    :data:`MAX_WALK_SECS` deadline checked at the top of the loop does.

    That deadline is checked BEFORE the pop, so the ``finally`` drain still owns
    every reference on the stack. Like the ``MAX_TREE_NODES_LIMIT`` cutoff above
    it, stopping early means the unvisited remainder was never classified, so
    ``saw_secure`` covers only what was reached — the same accepted bound as the
    node cutoff, and the reason the deadline is set three orders of magnitude
    above a measured healthy walk.

    Structural containers with no text of their own are ELIDED — they consume
    neither an index nor a rendered line — but their children are still visited at
    the parent's depth. A real Finder tree is mostly ``AXGroup`` scaffolding, and
    spending indices on it both wastes the node budget and makes the numbering the
    model reasons about sparse and confusing.

    *keep_index* additionally returns the live ``AXUIElement`` for that ONE index
    (the addressing path needs it) and ends the walk there, so addressing element 3
    does not walk 1,400 nodes. That element is returned as a **+1 reference the
    caller must release**; every other element the walk touched is released here.

    *window_bounds* is the target window's screen rect. When present, each record's
    geometry is stored WINDOW-RELATIVE; when absent, no frame is stored at all
    rather than a screen-absolute one, because a consumer cannot tell the two apart
    and the two mean different things.

    *focused* is the app's ``AXFocusedUIElement``, read ONCE by the caller — the
    walk only compares pointers against it. Reading it per node would be one extra
    AX round-trip on every node of every walk (~1,400 on Chrome) to answer a
    question with a single answer.

    **Reference ownership is tracked per stack entry.** ``ax_children`` returns +1
    references (they must be retained, because the AX children of a
    ``Copy``-returned array die with the array), so each one is released once the
    walk is done with it — including the entries still on the stack when a budget
    cuts the walk short, which the ``finally`` drains. The root *window* is NOT
    owned here; the caller that obtained it releases it.

    The one path the ``finally`` drain cannot cover is *keep_index*: the addressed
    node's children have already been read (and retained) by the time the index
    matches, and they are never pushed, so they are released explicitly there. That
    is not a cosmetic leak — every mutating action runs an addressing re-walk, so it
    would be a per-action leak of one node's whole child list.

        **``AXChildren`` alone is not the whole tree.** A table, outline or list
        routinely exposes its rows ONLY through ``AXRows`` (and a scrolled list only
        the on-screen ones through ``AXVisibleChildren``), reporting an empty or
        scaffolding-only ``AXChildren``. A children-only walk therefore renders a
        spreadsheet, a Finder list or a mail inbox as an empty container — which the
        model reads as "this app has no content" and answers by guessing
        coordinates. Reading all three and merging is what makes those apps
        addressable at all.

        For a :data:`ROW_BEARING_ROLES` container the alternate collections are read
        FIRST, so the rows take the low indices rather than landing behind the
        container's own scaffolding — the indices a model addresses are the early
        ones.

        **Deduplicated by element IDENTITY** (``CFEqual``, not handle equality): a
        row is commonly present in both ``AXRows`` and ``AXVisibleChildren``, and
        each read mints a distinct reference for it. Comparing addresses would let
        the same row through twice, and a duplicated row is worse than a missing
        one — the model would address index 7 and index 9 believing they are two
        different rows. Duplicates are released immediately so the dedup is not a
        leak.

        Reaching ``MAX_CHILDREN_PER_NODE`` sets ``truncated`` rather than silently
        dropping the tail. A container with more children than the cap would
        otherwise leave ``saw_secure`` reflecting only the first 512 while
        ``truncated`` stayed False — so the walk would report itself COMPLETE and
        non-secure, and ``capture_snapshot_image``'s fail-closed check (which
        refuses to capture a truncated walk) would have nothing to refuse on,
        leaving a password field as child 513 to keep the window's pixels
        capturable.

        ``truncated`` is exactly the right signal: it already means "there is more of
        this tree than you were shown", which is precisely true here, and the capture
        gate already reads it as "unknown ⇒ present".

        The cap bounds the MERGED list, so three collections cannot together exceed
        what one was allowed to — otherwise the memory bound the cap exists for would
        be silently tripled.

        Detected as ``len(children) >= limit`` rather than by asking for the real
        count: the cap exists so one pathological container cannot materialise 100k CF
        pointers, and re-reading the array to count it would reintroduce that cost. A
        node with EXACTLY the cap many children is therefore treated as truncated too
        — a false positive costs one suppressed screenshot, a false negative is the
        disclosure.
