"""The ONLY module in this package that touches Windows-native code.

Everything native for Windows lives here: the UI Automation COM client, its
vtable dispatch, VARIANT/BSTR marshalling, window enumeration, and the DPI
awareness scope. Every other Windows computer-use module talks to the OS through
the helpers below, so the FFI hazards are audited in one place — the same
property ``macos_ffi`` holds for macOS.

``import ctypes`` is a top-level import statement, but **no ``WinDLL`` runs at
module scope**. The libraries load inside :func:`_libraries`, cached in a module
global, and raise :class:`ComputerUseUnsupported` off Windows — so this module
imports cleanly on the macOS and Linux CI shards, and a test can exercise the
binding logic with a fake loader. ``from ctypes import wintypes`` supplies type
ALIASES only and imports cleanly on POSIX, which is what lets the structures
below sit at module scope on every platform.

UI Automation is COM-only — there is no C API — so every call is a manual vtable
dispatch. That makes the hazards here different in kind from the macOS ones:
**the slot index IS the ABI**, and a wrong index is an access violation that
kills the interpreter with no Python traceback, taking the gateway (and with it
cron, Slack and every session) down. Six hazards this module exists to contain,
each measured on Windows 11:

1. **A wrong vtable slot is a process abort, not an exception.** A blind slot
   sweep produced a real ``EXIT=139``. Hence :data:`_VTABLE`: every slot index in
   this package appears exactly once, here, and :func:`vcall` resolves by METHOD
   NAME so no call site can hand-roll an index.
2. **Two slots return ``S_OK`` while doing the WRONG thing.**
   ``ElementFromHandle`` is slot 6; slot 7 is ``ElementFromPoint``, and handed an
   HWND it reads it as a screen coordinate and cheerfully resolves to the whole
   DESKTOP. A desktop-scoped walk then reads every application's tree while
   looking like it worked, so :func:`element_from_hwnd` treats a NULL result as a
   hard error and never falls through.
3. **A missing ``argtypes`` truncates a 64-bit pointer to 32 bits.** An HWND
   passed as a bare Python int is the common form of this; every handle crosses
   the boundary as ``c_void_p``. :data:`_FN_SPECS` carries both ``argtypes`` and
   ``restype`` on every row and :func:`_bind` RAISES on ``argtypes=None`` rather
   than accepting the ctypes default.
4. **A BSTR must be decoded BEFORE ``VariantClear``.** Afterwards the freed block
   is reused, and different properties read back byte-identical — which looks
   exactly like a wrong-property bug and is not. :func:`variant_value` copies out
   first, with ``SysStringLen`` rather than a NUL scan so an embedded NUL cannot
   truncate a value.
5. **``restype`` must be ``c_long``, never ``ctypes.HRESULT``.** ``HRESULT``
   raises on a failure code, which turns an EXPECTED ``E_INVALIDARG`` — the
   normal answer for an unsupported property id — into an exception that reads
   like a crash.
6. **A ``ctypes.Structure`` declared in a function body leaks forever.**
   ``ctypes.POINTER`` memoises the type in a module-level dict with no eviction,
   so every call pins a fresh pair of type objects. Every structure and union
   here is at module scope.

**The secure-field decision is the security-critical function in this file.**
:func:`is_secure_element` gates three separate floors — value redaction, input
refusal and whole-window screenshot suppression — so it fails CLOSED. See its
docstring for the decision table and for why a cached value may never decide it.

    ``CUIAutomation8`` returns plain ``IUIAutomation`` with ``S_OK``, so the class

    What contains it instead: the executor is bounded and every verb is one call, so a

    UIPI — and it returns NORMALLY, so a discarded count means a modifier or mouse
    button is left HELD on the operator's own machine. Nothing later un-holds it: a
    stuck Ctrl alters every keystroke they type next, and a stuck mouse button turns
    every motion of their hand into a drag, which on a file manager moves their files.

    So the count is checked and the unaccepted records are resubmitted. ``SendInput``
    accepts a prefix, so by default the retry is exactly ``records[accepted:]`` — resending
    the whole batch would re-release keys already up, which is harmless but muddies what
    failed. Retrying is worth it here precisely because the alternative is not "the
    action failed" but "the operator's hardware is now wrong".

    **``atomic=True`` resends the WHOLE batch instead**, and a drag's release requires it.
    That batch is ``[move(end), button_up]``: the records are not independent, because the
    move is what AIMS the release. A tail-only retry after a partial acceptance resends the
    bare ``button_up``, which carries no coordinate and therefore releases wherever the
    cursor happens to be by then — the drop lands outside the window
    ``hwnd_owns_point`` authorized, which is precisely the defect the aimed release exists
    to prevent. Re-sending the move first is idempotent (a cursor position is state, not an
    edge), so the only cost is one redundant record.

    Raises :class:`ComputerUseUnsupported` when a record is still unreleased after

    separately, and are what the press and release are aimed at, so a caller that
    passes a path cannot accidentally press somewhere the confinement check did not
    authorize.

    **Each path point is submitted as its OWN ``SendInput`` call, and that is the
    difference between drawing a curve and drawing a polyline.** It looks like the
    opposite of what :func:`_send`'s docstring asks for, so the measurement is worth
    stating: 65 move records in one batch drew a visibly corner-y polyline, while the
    same 65 points as 65 separate calls drew a smooth curve. A ``WH_MOUSE_LL`` hook
    counted 65 of 65 events reaching the queue in BOTH shapes, so nothing is dropped
    — Windows synthesizes ``WM_MOUSEMOVE`` from queue *state* when the target's
    message pump asks, rather than queueing one message per injected event, so a
    single batch mutates the cursor position many times before the target samples it
    even once. Separate calls yield between them, which is what lets the pump observe
    the intermediate positions. An inter-call *sleep* was measured to add nothing (0ms,
    2ms and 8ms drew identically), so there is none: it would only cost wall-clock
    while the operator's mouse button is held.

    **The press and the release are each AIMED, in one batch with their own move.** The
    press is ``[move(start), down]`` and the release is ``[move(end), up]``, and the
    aimed release is not decoration: a bare ``up`` record carries no coordinate, so it
    releases wherever the cursor happens to be when the OS processes it. With the path
    now submitted as N separate calls there are N yield points where the old single
    batch had one, so a foreign mouse move — the operator's own hand, another injector —
    can land between the last path point and the release. Since a release is where a
    DROP lands, and ``start``/``end`` are the two points ``hwnd_owns_point``
    authorized, re-aiming immediately before the ``up`` is what keeps the drop inside
    the window that was checked. It costs one extra record.

    The release is submitted even if the press or any move was rejected, for the same
    reason the keyboard releases unconditionally: a mouse button left down is a stuck
    button on the operator's real mouse, and every subsequent motion of their own hand
    becomes a drag, which on a file manager moves their files. The ``finally`` covers
    an exception; the accepted counts cover the quieter case of a ``SendInput``
    truncated mid-way (a lower-level hook, or UIPI), which returns NORMALLY. Both end
    with the button released, and a short delivery is reported rather than passed off
    as done — a drag that pressed and moved but never released is exactly the
    stuck-button state, and reporting success would leave the caller believing the drop
    landed.

    The release batch is built BEFORE the travel loop, so the ``finally`` cannot fail
    while constructing it: ``_move_to`` normalizes against the virtual screen and can

    -101. So the check authorized one pixel and the event landed on another, which at a

    a minimized window (parked at -32000,-32000) and a DWM-CLOAKED one (a packaged app
    suspended in the background, or a window on another virtual desktop) both pass it.
    Measured on one desktop: 4 of 12 windows that passed the old filter were not
    visible to the operator. That is not cosmetic — ``render`` and the tool
    descriptions both say "on-screen windows", ``build_snapshot`` succeeds on a cloaked
    window and publishes an origin that OVERLAPS other applications' real pixels, and
    the capture returns a full bitmap of a window the operator cannot see. Confinement
    then fails closed correctly, but its refusal tells the model to re-read bounds that
    never change, so the retry cannot terminate.

    ``IsIconic`` plus ``DWMWA_CLOAKED`` is the Windows equivalent of the macOS list's
