"""``kirocrew computer`` — human-facing computer-use diagnostics and a debug driver.

Three subcommands:

* ``doctor [--json]`` — platform support, the keystone primary enable, and the
  ADVISORY macOS permission probe. ``--json`` is the machine form the dashboard
  shells out for its Settings permission rows, which is how the native
  accessibility probe stays OUT of the gateway process: a ctypes fault in a
  short-lived subprocess costs one diagnostic, while the same fault in-gateway
  would take down every session, the cron scheduler, the Slack socket and every
  dashboard websocket at once.
* ``apps`` — the on-screen application list, so a user can see the names and
  bundle ids the agent will match against.
* ``call`` — run ONE computer-use tool, or a JSON array of them **in a single
  process**, against the same dispatch chokepoint the agent uses. See below.

Deliberately NO ``kirocrew computer state <app>``. That would be a second,
CLI-shaped spelling of an LLM-facing capability, and the MCP-first rule requires
an LLM-facing capability to be an MCP tool (it is: ``computer_get_state``).
``doctor`` is a permission diagnostic rather than a capability, and ``apps`` has
its MCP twin (``computer_list_apps``), so neither brushes the rule.

**Why ``call`` does not brush the MCP-first rule either.** It is not a new
capability and it adds no tool: it is a *harness* over the existing ten, for a
human reproducing a failure at a terminal. The rule exists so the model gets a
structured tool rather than being told to shell out — and the model already has
all eleven as MCP tools. ``call`` deliberately has no MCP twin, because a tool that
runs other tools would let a model launder a per-call gate decision through one
approved invocation.

**``call`` is fully gated, and that is the point of routing it through
``tools.dispatch_tool`` rather than reaching into ``service``.** Every call goes
through the same ordered chokepoint as an agent call: the fail-closed keystone
primary enable, the audit-only ``gate.require_computer_use``, the built-in app
denylist, index freshness, the secure-target refusals, and the observation
ceiling. So this command cannot see or do anything the agent could
not, which is exactly what makes it a faithful reproduction tool. Two
consequences worth stating rather than discovering:

* the session key is the attended CLI surface (:data:`_CLI_SESSION_KEY`) — a real
  surface the gate accepts, not a bypass sentinel;
* ``approval_recorded`` is left at ``False``. There is no approval ceiling for
  it to satisfy, so the flag changes no outcome — but it is still
  never minted here, because doing so would be the CLI asserting a prompt that
  nobody answered on this leg (asserted by an AST test over the whole package).

**Why a whole array in one process.** ``element_index`` values only mean anything
relative to the ``computer_get_state`` that produced them, and the cache that
holds that mapping (``index.SnapshotIndex``, reached via the shared service
singleton) is per-process with a 90s TTL. Two ``kirocrew computer call``
invocations therefore cannot share indices at all — the second would refuse with
"no state for …". ``--calls`` exists so a snapshot-then-act sequence is
reproducible from one command line, which is the shape the reference
implementation's ``call --calls`` has for the same reason.

Hand-rolled dispatch mirroring ``browser/cli.py`` rather than argparse
subparsers: the command surface is two words plus free-form arguments, and the
parent CLI already forwards ``REMAINDER``.

Wrap a value with spaces in shell quotes: text='hello there'.

Every call runs through the same gate the agent does — the primary enable,
security policy, the app denylist and the secure-field refusals all apply, so
this cannot reach anything the agent could not. Under a policy that forces
interactive approval, a mutating call is refused here: there is no prompt on this
leg for anyone to answer.

Computer use is OFF by default and can only be enabled by you, from the
dashboard: Settings -> Computer Use. An agent cannot enable it.
