"""Gateway-side SUPERVISOR for the Cursor Motion overlay process.

This is the only module the rest of computer use talks to about the fake cursor.
It owns exactly three things:

1. deciding whether an overlay should exist at all (macOS + the ``cursor_motion``
   opt-in, default OFF);
2. the lifecycle of the ``kiro_crew.computer_use.overlay_proc`` child — lazy
   spawn, bounded retry, reap;
3. turning a "the agent is about to click here" event into a
   :class:`~kiro_crew.computer_use.cursor_motion.MotionPlan` and shipping it down
   the child's stdin.

**The overlay is PURELY COSMETIC and this module's whole design follows from
that.** It has two absolute properties, and both are asserted by tests:

* **It never raises into a caller.** Every public method swallows every
  exception. A tool call that would have succeeded must not fail because AppKit
  was unavailable, the child died, or the pipe was full — a failed overlay
  degrades to "no visual cursor", never to a failed tool call.
* **It never blocks the event loop.** The spawn is
  ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec``; the only wait is a bounded
  ``asyncio.wait_for`` on the readiness line. The ANIMATION itself is
  fire-and-forget: the command is written and the coroutine returns, because the
  child draws on its own run loop and making a caller await ~1.4s of decoration
  would put a cosmetic subsystem on the latency path of a real action.

It is also a **no-op by construction** off macOS and when disabled: the enable
check runs before anything else in every method, so a Linux CI shard exercises
these bodies and observes that nothing is spawned.

Why a separate process at all: AppKit requires a main-thread run loop and the
gateway's main thread IS the asyncio loop. See ``overlay_proc``'s docstring.

      event loop with ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and the future is NOT awaited.
      Waiting for the glide would add its duration to every pointer click's latency
      for a purely cosmetic effect, and a wedged AppKit child would then stall the
      tool call itself;
    * **it never raises.** A decoration must not be able to turn a successful click
      into a failed tool call, so every failure — no running loop, a dead child, a
      full pipe — is swallowed at debug;
    * **it is not a permit.** By the time this runs the click has already been
      authorized upstream and its method resolved to a pointer-moving one. Drawing
      a cursor grants nothing, and skipping the drawing denies nothing.

    Ordering is best-effort by design: the click may land a few milliseconds before
    the drawn cursor finishes its glide. Making it strictly-before would mean
    awaiting an animation on the critical path, which is the trade this rejects.
