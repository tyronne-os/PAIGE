"""Snapshot, index and screenshot orchestration — the BLOCKING half of computer use.

Every method here is **synchronous and may block**: it calls into a
:class:`~kiro_crew.computer_use.backend.ComputerUseBackend`, which on macOS means
accessibility round-trips to another process and an in-process CoreGraphics
capture. Measured walks run 40-70ms on a healthy app and are bounded by the
driver's messaging timeout, but a genuinely hung target app can park the calling
thread for the whole timeout.

That is why this module is deliberately **sync with no asyncio anywhere**: it runs
in the gateway, and the gateway's rule is that no blocking syscall touches the
event loop. :mod:`kiro_crew.computer_use.tools` is the async half — it offloads
every call here onto ``run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), ...)``. Keeping the
split at the module boundary means a future caller cannot accidentally await a
blocking body, and this module stays trivially unit-testable against the fake
backend with no event loop at all.

Responsibilities, and only these:

* resolve an app query to an :class:`AppRef` (always from the on-screen window
  list — never a process-name search);
* walk a window into a :class:`Snapshot`, persist any captured pixels, and cache
  the result in the shared :class:`~kiro_crew.computer_use.index.SnapshotIndex`;
* re-walk and compare fingerprints before a mutating action;
* forward the mutating verbs to the driver.

Deliberately NOT here: the primary-enable check, governance, the target policy and
the response shaping. Those all live at the one dispatch chokepoint in
``tools.py`` so there is exactly one place to read to know what is enforced.
