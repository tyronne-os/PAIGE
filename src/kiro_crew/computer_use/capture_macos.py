"""Window capture: pixels to a persisted, size-bounded JPEG. Fully in-process.

**No subprocess and no image library.** Not ``/usr/sbin/screencapture``, not
Pillow. ``CGWindowListCreateImage`` grabs one window's pixels and ImageIO's
``CGImageDestination`` encodes them, with ImageIO performing the downscale itself
via ``kCGImageDestinationImageMaxPixelSize``. Three liabilities disappear with
that choice: there is no spawn node for the spawn audit to account for, no
optional dependency to degrade around (Pillow is declared in neither
``setup.cfg`` nor ``pyproject.toml``), and no 204ms process launch per capture.

Why the image is a PATH and never bytes. The MCP transport
(``validation.build_tool_response``) emits ``{"content":[{"type":"text",...}]}``
and cannot express an image block, so a relayed screenshot would have to be
base64 in text — measured at ~41,000 tokens for a single raw window PNG. The
compressed file goes to disk and only its path is relayed, which the model reads
with ``fs_read`` if and only if the accessibility tree was insufficient. At
1280px/q0.55 a real window encodes to ~24KB (~8,300 tokens if read at all), and
the image is corroboration rather than the primary channel.

Size reporting comes from :func:`macos_ffi.jpeg_dimensions` — the ENCODED
dimensions, parsed back out of the JPEG. ``CGImageGetWidth`` on the *input* image
would over-report by the downscale factor (verified: a 1676x1320 window encodes to
1280x1008), and a wrong size in the result would make a model reason about a
resolution it is not going to get.

The encoded frame has exactly one other consumer: :mod:`screencast` relays these
same bytes to the dashboard's floating live view. It is a relay, not a second
capture — no extra ``CGWindowListCreateImage`` call, no timer, no full-screen
grab — and it re-checks ``has_secure`` plus the permitted screenshot channel
before anything leaves the process.

Accepted residual risk, stated here because a reviewer will find it: the persisted
JPEGs live in a ``0o700`` temp dir the agent can reach with ``fs_read``. That is
the posture the browse module already ships. Computer use widens WHAT can be in
frame (any window, not one browser tab), which is why capture is per-window and
never full-screen, why a window holding any secure field is not captured at all,
and why the directory is ring-trimmed. It is not claimed to be closed.
