"""Windows window capture: ``PrintWindow`` into a DIB, encoded as JPEG by GDI+.

The counterpart of :mod:`capture_macos`, and it makes the same trade: the
accessibility tree is the primary channel and the image is corroboration, so a
capture failure degrades the result rather than failing the observation.

**No new dependency.** GDI+ is used rather than WIC because ``gdiplus.dll``
exposes a FLAT C API — no COM vtable dispatch, so none of the slot-index hazards
:mod:`windows_ffi` exists to contain apply to the encoder. Pillow is declared in
neither ``setup.cfg`` nor ``pyproject.toml`` and must not be imported here, and a
subprocess encoder would need a ``test_spawn_audit.BENIGN_SPAWNS`` entry.

Three Windows-specific findings shape the capture:

* **``PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT`` at 32bpp is the only combination that works**, and the
  two halves are inseparable. The flag renders through DWM, so it needs a 32bpp
  BGRA target; against a 24bpp DIB it returns 1 and writes nothing. Measured
  across depth x flag on two windows: a WinForms window yielded 1 distinct byte
  value at 24bpp and 180 at 32bpp, and a Chromium window yielded 1 distinct value
  for every other combination and a full frame only at 32bpp with this flag. A
  24bpp buffer therefore disables the flag silently everywhere, which is not
  visible in a code reading — it looks like a pixel-format preference.
* **There is no ``BitBlt`` fallback, by design.** A window DC is a view onto the
  SCREEN, so ``BitBlt`` copies any overlapping window's pixels into a frame
  labelled as the target's. See :func:`_capture_window_bitmap` for why that is a
  disclosure rather than a degradation.
* **A capture reports SUCCESS while producing a blank frame**, so the return value
  cannot be trusted at all: a swapchain surface is simply not in the DC being
  copied. The PIXELS are validated (:func:`_has_content`) and a uniform frame is a
  failed capture, never relayed — handing the model a blank rectangle is worse than
  handing it no image, because it would reason about the blank as though it were
  the application.

The spool PATH, the ring trim and the owner-only protection are all shared with
:mod:`capture_macos` (``shots_dir`` resolves through ``tempfile.gettempdir()``,
already ``%TEMP%`` here). Both layers of that protection are needed on Windows and
neither substitutes for the other: the directory grant is inheritable
(``restrict_dir_to_owner`` emits ``(OI)(CI)``) so files created inside inherit the
owner-only DACL, but inheritance governs only what is CREATED from here on -- a
frame that already exists keeps its own DACL, and Windows grants Bypass Traverse
Checking to Everyone by default, so a permissive pre-existing file stays reachable
through a tightened parent. A file-only grant, conversely, leaves the directory
itself listable. The directory is tightened once per process and each frame is
tightened as it is written.

    ``PrintWindow`` returns TRUE while producing a uniform bitmap for a swapchain
    surface, so success cannot be read from the return value.

    **Whole pixels, not individual bytes.** A byte-wise distinct count is defeated by
    a uniform OPAQUE frame: 32bpp BGRA grey is ``20 20 20 FF``, two distinct byte
    values from one repeated pixel, so a blank window passes a two-value threshold on
    its alpha lane alone. Comparing pixels also makes the channel question disappear —
    every channel is part of the compared value by construction, rather than depending
    on a probe step landing on the one that differs.

    The alpha lane is EXCLUDED from the comparison. GDI leaves it undefined on the
    ``PrintWindow`` path (a fresh DIB section is zeroed, and what DWM writes there is
    not specified), so including it makes the verdict depend on a byte no renderer
    promises — in either direction: uniform alpha over varied colour is real content,
    and varying alpha over uniform colour is not.

    The sample is spread ACROSS the whole buffer, not taken from its head. The DIB
    is top-down, so the first bytes are the top scanlines — a fixed 64 KiB prefix
    on a large window is only the title bar (~11 rows of 1158), which produced two
    real failures: a window with a solid caption bar over varied content read as
    blank, and WindowsTerminal's present caption over an absent swapchain body read
    as content and relayed a blank frame. Striding over the whole buffer inspects
    the body those both hinge on.

    Scanline padding is not a pixel either, and *width* is what excludes it. Rows are
    DWORD-aligned; a 32bpp row is inherently aligned so there is nothing to skip
    today, but the exclusion stays because it is what makes the function correct for
    any ``bits_per_pixel`` rather than only the current one. It mattered concretely at
    24bpp, where pad bytes on a blank frame supplied the second distinct value all by
    themselves — measured on 694 of the 1245 padded widths in 300..1959, each relaying
    a blank frame as content.

    Falls back to a byte-wise comparison when *width* is unknown, which keeps the
    function total: without a width there is no way to locate a pixel boundary. Every
    in-tree caller passes one.

    """Capture *hwnd* into a GDI+ bitmap. Returns ``(bitmap, width, height)``.

    ``PrintWindow`` with ``PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT`` is the ONLY path, and the PIXELS
    decide rather than the return value.

    There is deliberately no ``BitBlt`` fallback. A window DC is a view onto the
    SCREEN, not onto the window's own backing store, so ``BitBlt`` from it copies
    whatever is on those pixels — including an overlapping window belonging to an
    application the caller was never authorized for. That breaks the same
    confinement ``apps_windows.hwnd_owns_point`` enforces for the pointer, and it
    breaks it on the OBSERVATION path, where the secure-field floor cannot help:
    that floor walks the TARGET's tree, so a password box belonging to the window
    on top is not something it can see, let alone suppress. A blank frame is a
    failed capture and degrades to a tree-only snapshot; a frame containing another
    application is a disclosure, so the two are not interchangeable fallbacks.

    The buffer is sized from the window's rect **as the TARGET reports it**, which
    is not the same number the caller's DPI-aware context reads for a DPI-UNAWARE
    window. ``PrintWindow`` asks the window to draw itself in its own coordinate
    space, so a legacy Win32 window renders at its logical size no matter what the
    caller's awareness is: measured 620x392 drawn into both a 620x400 buffer and a
    775x500 one, leaving the aware-sized buffer with a black L-shaped margin and an
    image that does not map linearly onto the window rect the element frames use.
    A DPI-aware window fills whichever buffer it is given (1296 unaware, 1620
    aware). ``windows_ffi.window_render_scale`` supplies the ratio, so the buffer is
    exactly the region the window draws into and carries no margin.
