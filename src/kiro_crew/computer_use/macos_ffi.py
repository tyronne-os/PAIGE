"""The ONLY module in this package that touches ctypes.

Everything native lives here: CoreFoundation memory discipline, the
Accessibility (AX) attribute/action calls, CoreGraphics window enumeration and
event synthesis, and the in-process ImageIO encode. Every other computer-use
module talks to macOS through the helpers below, so the FFI hazards are audited
in one place instead of scattered across five files.

``import ctypes`` is a top-level import statement (AUTOSDE ``top-level-imports``
is about statements, not about *loading* a library), but **no ``CDLL`` or
``find_library`` runs at module scope**. The frameworks load inside
:func:`_frameworks`, cached in a module global, and raise
:class:`ComputerUseUnsupported` off macOS — so this module imports cleanly on the
Linux and Windows CI shards and a test can exercise the binding logic with a fake
``CDLL``.

Six hazards this module exists to contain. Each was reproduced live on a real Mac
(darwin-arm64, Darwin 25.5.0); the failure mode of the first three is a **process
abort**, not a Python exception, so none of them can be handled by a caller.

1. **A missing ``argtypes`` truncates a 64-bit pointer to 32 bits and
   SEGFAULTS.** One omitted ``argtypes`` produced a real ``EXIT=139``. Hence the
   declarative :data:`_FN_SPECS` table and a single bind pass: no function in
   this module can be reached un-bound, and :func:`_bind` RAISES on
   ``argtypes=None`` rather than accepting the ctypes default.
2. **``CFArrayGetValueAtIndex`` past the end raises an UNCATCHABLE ObjC
   ``NSRangeException``** — verified ``EXIT=134``, ``libc++abi: terminating``, on
   an empty ``CFArray``. ctypes cannot translate an ObjC exception into a Python
   one, so every array read goes through :func:`cf_array_items`, which reads the
   count FIRST and never indexes out of range.
3. **``CGEventCreateScrollWheelEvent`` is VARIADIC and ctypes marshals its
   variadic tail incorrectly on arm64.** Asking for ``(axis1=-3, axis2=0)``
   through the 5-argument form produced ``axis2=30416`` — garbage that would
   scroll a live window sideways by an arbitrary amount. Only the fixed
   (``wheelCount=1``) prototype is declared, and the second axis is set
   afterwards through the non-variadic
   ``CGEventSetIntegerValueField`` (verified exact for every input).
4. **``kCFTypeDictionaryKeyCallBacks`` is a STRUCT, not a pointer.**
   ``c_void_p.in_dll(...).value`` reads its first word — ``None`` — and passing
   that means "no callbacks", i.e. CF neither retains nor releases the dictionary
   contents. :func:`_cf_type_dict` passes ``ctypes.addressof`` instead.
5. **A synthesized key event inherits the user's LIVE modifier state.** Typing
   ``abc`` produced ``' I Abc'`` until the events were built from a *private*
   event source with flags set EXPLICITLY on every event. See :func:`post_key`.
6. **A CFString leak is a real RSS bug.** One tree walk creates thousands of
   them, so :func:`cf_string` is a context manager that always ``CFRelease``s.
7. **``CGEventCreateMouseEvent`` takes a ``CGPoint`` BY VALUE**, and there is no
   generic "mouse down" event type — the type is PER-BUTTON. Passing two bare
   doubles mis-marshals the call under the AArch64 convention, and posting a
   right-click as ``kCGEventLeftMouseDown`` with ``button=1`` is delivered as a
   LEFT click. Both are handled by :data:`MOUSE_EVENT_TYPES` +
   :func:`_mouse_event`. A multi-click is also NOT repeated pairs: it is a pair
   carrying ``kCGMouseEventClickState``, which is where AppKit reads
   ``NSEvent.clickCount`` from.

**One deliberate exception to the "``CGEventPostToPid`` only" rule.**
``CGEventPost`` (the global HID tap) and ``CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`` are bound
and are called from :func:`post_mouse_global` / :func:`post_mouse_drag_global`
and nowhere else. Those are the ``click_method: "global"`` path, which
deliberately takes over the operator's physical mouse and is therefore reachable
only when the model NAMED that method — ``auto`` never resolves onto it, and the
resolution happens upstream at the dispatch chokepoint. A test pins the call-site
count, so a stray global post anywhere else in the module fails CI.

Every AX read is also type-checked with ``CFGetTypeID`` *before* the value is
used: AX attributes are polymorphic and a wrong-type read is another segfault
rather than an exception.

    Encoded per character as UTF-16LE so an astral character is delivered as its
    full surrogate pair in one event rather than as two lone surrogates.

    **The whole string is encoded BEFORE the first keystroke is posted.** Encoding
    inside the loop meant an unencodable character — a lone surrogate, which
    ``str`` permits and UTF-16 cannot represent — raised ``UnicodeEncodeError``
    *after* every preceding character had already been typed into a live
    application. The caller then saw a failure while the target held a partial
    string, and a model told "typing failed" would retry and double the prefix.
    Encoding up front makes the call all-or-nothing: it either types the whole
    string or refuses having typed nothing, which is the contract the driver's
    failed ``DriverResult`` claims. ``surrogatepass`` is deliberately NOT used —
    delivering a lone surrogate to AppKit is not a meaningful keystroke.
