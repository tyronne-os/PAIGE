"""``click_method: "sky_click"`` — the PRIVATE SkyLight background-window click.

**This module is quarantine.** It is the ONLY file in the package allowed to touch
undocumented Apple ABI, and it exists as its own module rather than living in
``macos_ffi.py`` so that:

* ``macos_ffi.py`` keeps its "public frameworks only" property, which is what makes
  it reviewable against Apple's documentation;
* every future macOS-compatibility break has ONE review boundary — if a point
  release changes a byte offset or drops a symbol, the blast radius is this file;
* the private surface can be disabled wholesale (see :func:`available`) without
  touching any other code path.

Other implementations of this technique isolate it the same way; at least one ships
it in a separate signed helper process rather than inside the main binary, which is
the same instinct one level further. Worth revisiting if this surface grows.

**What it buys.** ``sky_click`` clicks a window that is BEHIND other windows,
without raising it and without moving the operator's pointer. Neither public path
can do that: ``accessibility`` needs an addressable element (and many canvases have
none), and ``app_post`` delivers to the app but is ignored by renderers that
hit-test against the window server's idea of which window is in front — the
browser-engine-backed apps, in practice. That
gap is real and was hit in practice: a Freeform canvas behind a Zoom annotation
overlay could not be drawn on by any public method.

**Where the ABI comes from.** The symbol declarations and the event-field recipe are
derived from prior permissively-licensed open-source work that reverse-engineered
this path (attributed in ``NOTICE``). None of it is published by
Apple: the byte layout of the activation record and the numeric event fields are
observed behaviour, and ``WindowServer`` does not document the accepted width of the
click-group field. Treat every constant here as observed, not specified.

**Fail-closed, always.** :func:`available` reports which symbols are missing and
every entry point raises a typed, model-readable refusal when the SPI is not
usable. A future macOS that removes ``SLEventPostToPid`` must degrade to "this
method is unavailable, use app_post" — never to a crash, and never to a silently
mis-delivered click.
