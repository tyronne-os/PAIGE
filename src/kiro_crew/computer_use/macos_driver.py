"""The macOS :class:`ComputerUseBackend` — thin glue over the Stage-2 modules.

Deliberately thin. Discovery lives in :mod:`apps_macos`, the walk in
:mod:`snapshot_macos`, capture in :mod:`capture_macos`, the FFI in
:mod:`macos_ffi`, and every *policy* decision lives upstream at the dispatch
chokepoint. This class only translates the ABC's method signatures into those
calls and, critically, converts every failure into a :class:`DriverResult`.

**No exception crosses this seam.** Each public method wraps its work in
:func:`_guarded`. That is not defensive habit: the MCP loop dispatches tool calls
on a worker thread, and an exception escaping into it takes the call down, while an
un-caught ``ComputerUseUnsupported`` at import time would make the whole backend
look broken rather than the one action.

Two design notes that a reader will otherwise question:

* **``element`` handles are not cached across calls.** A mutating action re-walks
  the tree to find the element at the requested index. Holding a
  ``AXUIElement`` pointer between tool calls would mean acting on a stale handle
  whose widget may have been destroyed — a use-after-free in another process's
  address space, not a Python error. Re-walking costs 25-70ms and is what makes
  the caller's fingerprint check meaningful, since the fingerprint must come from
  the same walk as the element being acted on.
* **Three click paths, and only one of them touches the operator's cursor.**
  ``accessibility`` is ``AXUIElementPerformAction(elem, "AXPress")`` — no pointer
  involved at all, and still the default whenever an element index is available.
  ``app_post`` posts a located mouse event with ``CGEventPostToPid``, so the target
  app sees a click at a point while the physical cursor stays put (verified live).
  ``global`` is the one path that warps the real cursor
  (``CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`` + a global ``CGEventPost``); it exists because
  some UI is only reachable by a physical click, and it is reachable only when the
  model NAMES it — ``policy.resolve_click_method`` never resolves ``auto`` onto it.
  This driver does not evaluate that; it is settled at the dispatch chokepoint
  before ``req.moves_pointer`` can be True here. A driver must therefore never
  upgrade a method on its own.
