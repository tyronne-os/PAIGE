"""Cross-platform ``flock`` shim so POSIX-only modules import on Windows.

The gateway (and everything that takes an advisory file lock — cron, gateway
singleton, session-pid, autonudge, agent_discovery) runs only on macOS/Linux. But the
Windows ``kirocrew cloud`` thin-client runs ``python -m kiro_crew cloud launch``,
which imports the *whole* CLI — pulling those modules in at import time. A bare
module-level ``import fcntl`` (POSIX-only) would then crash the launcher on
Windows before it ever reaches the cloud handler.

This module provides the ``fcntl`` call surface those modules use — ``flock`` +
``LOCK_*`` (advisory file locks) and ``ioctl`` (PTY/terminal control):
- On POSIX: thin pass-throughs to the real :mod:`fcntl`.
- On Windows (no ``fcntl``): ``flock`` is a **no-op** and the constants are
  dummies; ``ioctl`` raises ``NotImplementedError`` (it's only used by the PTY
  terminal handler, which never runs on Windows). This is safe because the only
  processes that lock or drive a PTY are the gateway/cron/session machinery,
  which never run on Windows — the Windows path only provisions a *remote* Linux
  box and exits. It is NOT a general-purpose Windows implementation; it exists
  solely to keep the import graph loadable so the cloud client works.

Usage: replace ``import fcntl`` + ``fcntl.flock(...)`` / ``fcntl.ioctl(...)``
with ``from kiro_crew import flock_compat as fcntl`` (same call surface).
