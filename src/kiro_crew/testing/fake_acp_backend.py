"""Fake ACP model backend for offline E2E testing and demos.

Speaks the minimal subset of the Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over
newline-delimited stdio) that ``kiro_crew.acp.client.AcpClient`` drives:

    initialize        -> {protocolVersion, agentCapabilities: {loadSession: false}}
    session/new       -> {sessionId}
    session/set_mode  -> {}   (host awaits it; reply so the handshake never blocks)
    session/set_model -> {}
    session/prompt    -> stream update(s), then {stopReason: "end_turn"}

Prompt-driven behaviour on ``session/prompt`` (the reply is always sent last):

* Default text -> stream one ``agent_message_chunk`` (the canned reply).
* ``[[TOOL]]`` in the prompt -> also emit a ``tool_call`` + ``tool_call_update``
  (no permission). Exercises the tool-card UI and is deterministic headless:
  kiro-cli likewise emits tool calls that never raise ``session/request_permission``
  for pre-approved tools. The emitted ``rawInput`` carries the reserved purpose
  argument under its camelCase spelling (see ``_TOOL_PURPOSE``), so the pill's
  concise-label path is covered by the harness.
* ``[[PERMISSION]]`` in the prompt -> the ``[[TOOL]]`` sequence PLUS a
  server->client ``session/request_permission`` (to surface the approval
  modal). This is **fire-and-forget**: the fake does not gate its own
  completion on the outcome, and the host's answer is ignored. Resolving that
  permission needs the dashboard/UI, so this path is for Playwright E2E and
  live demos -- NOT the headless backend suite (a headless host has nothing to
  resolve the modal and the turn would stall).
* ``[[GATED]]`` in the prompt -> like ``[[PERMISSION]]`` but the fake WAITS for
  the host's answer (bounded by ``PERMISSION_WAIT_SECS``) and reflects it: a
  reject/cancel outcome yields ``status: "failed"`` on the tool_call_update.
  On timeout it reports ``completed``, preserving the never-block guarantee.
* ``[[SLOW]]`` -> stream ``SLOW_CHUNKS`` chunks with a delay, checking for a
  ``session/cancel`` between each. A cancel ends the turn early with
  ``stopReason: "cancelled"`` (the ACP soft-stop ack the host waits for).
* ``[[SLOW_NOACK]]`` -> the same slow stream but deliberately DEAF to cancel,
  so the host's ``soft_stop_budget_secs`` expires. Models an agent wedged in a
  long tool call, which is the "Stop Failed, Session Reset" path.
* ``[[SLOW_LATEACK]]`` -> honours the cancel like ``[[SLOW]]`` but winds down
  over ``SLOW_LATEACK_CHUNKS`` more chunks first. ``[[SLOW]]`` acks within one
  chunk, so the host's ``soft_pending`` state lasts ~250ms on average and a
  loaded browser can miss it entirely; the wind-down makes that state
  observable while still acking well inside the budget.
* ``[[ERROR]]`` -> reply with a JSON-RPC error instead of a result.
* ``[[MAXTOKENS]]`` / ``[[REFUSAL]]`` -> alternate terminal ``stopReason``.

Observing a cancel mid-turn requires reading stdin while a prompt is streaming,
so ``main()`` reads on a background thread into a queue rather than looping
read->handle. Calling ``_handle`` directly (as the unit tests do) leaves that
queue empty, every wait times out, and the default behaviour is unchanged.

Deterministic, offline, no network, no auth, stdlib-only. Reachable ONLY via
the ``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`` override (the provider stays ``acp``); it is never
selectable from a real gateway. Run standalone as
``python -m kiro_crew.testing.fake_acp_backend`` (the pytest harness and the
live-test harness both point ``KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`` at a launcher that runs it).
``AcpClient`` invokes it as ``<launcher> acp [--agent NAME ...]`` -- argv is
ignored on that path and the protocol is driven entirely over stdio. The
``--version`` and ``whoami`` commands return deterministic success so the
offline gateway exercises the same first-run readiness gate as production.
