"""Test harness for spawning isolated KiroCrew gateways.

Companion to the ``--test-mode`` / ``--json-ready`` / ``--port`` / ``--approval``
CLI flags on ``kirocrew gateway``. Provides a context manager that spins up
an isolated, headless gateway from the current workspace's source tree (not
the system-installed ``kirocrew``), reads the ``KIROCREW_READY:{...}`` line
off stdout, and tears down cleanly on exit.

Transport-agnostic: ``GatewayHandle`` exposes the URL plus a few metadata
fields. The caller chooses the driver (Playwright via DSO Frontend MCP is
the recommended one; plain HTTP for backend-only smoke tests is fine but
not the recommended path).

Usage:

    from kiro_crew.testing.harness import spawn_feature_gateway

    with spawn_feature_gateway() as handle:
        # drive Playwright / urllib / etc against handle.url
        ...
    # subprocess and tmp KIROCREW_HOME are gone by here

Reusable primitives:

    ``parse_ready_line`` and ``terminate_pgid`` are public, I/O-agnostic
    building blocks. Out-of-process supervisors that drive a *detached*
    gateway (tail its log for the READY line, terminate it later by pid
    without holding the ``Popen``) can reuse them instead of re-implementing
    the wire-contract parse and the SIGTERM→SIGKILL group kill.

    spawn — share the same teardown semantics as the in-process harness. The

    ``start_new_session=True``).

        pid: Process-group leader pid.

        wait: Optional exit-detection hook, called as ``wait(grace)``; it

            ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` when the grace window elapses (i.e.

    Does NOT reap: a supervisor that owns the ``Popen`` should ``proc.wait()``
