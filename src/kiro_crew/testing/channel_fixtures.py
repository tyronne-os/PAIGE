"""Vendor-API fixtures with provenance, plus shape conformance.

A wire fixture is a *claim about someone else's API*. Written as a bare Python
literal it is indistinguishable from a guess, so a shape nobody ever verified
guards the whole stack with the same authority as one captured from the live
vendor. That is how the iLink QR bug survived a green suite: the code assumed
``qrcode_img_content`` was image bytes, the fixtures agreed with the code, and
nothing recorded that the assumption had never been checked.

This module makes the claim explicit and testable:

* every fixture carries a ``_provenance`` block naming its
  :class:`Source` — ``live_probe`` (observed against the real API),
  ``vendor_doc`` (transcribed from published docs), or ``assumed`` (our
  inference, unverified);
* :func:`shape_of` reduces a payload to a key/type skeleton, and
  :func:`assert_same_shape` diffs two skeletons — so a live response can be
  compared against a stored fixture without pinning volatile values
  (tokens, ids, timestamps);
* :func:`unverified` enumerates every ``assumed`` fixture, so the gap is a
  visible inventory rather than an unknown.

The fixtures ROOT is always supplied by the caller: this module ships in the
runtime wheel, where no ``test/`` tree exists, so a default derived from
``__file__`` would point at an unpackaged path for every installed consumer.
``channel`` and ``name`` are validated as single path components before any
filesystem access, so a fixture identifier can never escape that root.

Refresh workflow (the only way a fixture should change):

1. Run the endpoint against the real API with real credentials, authorized.
2. Save the observed body via :func:`write_fixture` with
   ``source=Source.LIVE_PROBE`` and a reference (date, request id, probe
   script). ``write_fixture`` refuses to silently downgrade a ``live_probe``
   fixture to ``assumed``.
3. Re-run the suite. Every layer above is now verified against the observed
   shape; a vendor change is a one-file edit that re-verifies the stack.

    ``_resolve_within`` proves containment at CHECK time; a symlink planted
    between that check and this write would still be followed by an ordinary
    ``write_text``. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` closes that race at the syscall: if the leaf
    is a symlink, ``open`` fails instead of writing through it.

    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` is POSIX-only, so it degrades to 0 on Windows -- where the
    containment check remains the guard. Kept narrow deliberately: this is the
    one place the module writes.

    Known residual (accepted, not exploitable here): the guard covers the LEAF
    only. A concurrent actor could still swap an intermediate directory for a
    symlink between the containment check and ``mkdir``/``open``. Closing that
    would need descriptor-relative traversal (``openat`` with
    ``O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW`` per component) and has no portable Windows
    equivalent. It buys nothing against this module's actual threat model: the
    root comes from test code, never from a model or remote input, the fixture
    is read back by the same test process, and an actor who can plant a symlink
    inside the fixture tree mid-run can simply edit the test instead.

    Ownership of the descriptor transfers exactly ONCE: if ``fdopen`` raises we
    still own the raw fd and must close it; once it succeeds the file object owns
    it exclusively. Closing in both places would double-close the same NUMBER,
    and another thread could have reused it in between -- shutting an unrelated
    file or socket.

    The write is ATOMIC: bytes land in a temporary sibling that is fsynced and
    then ``os.replace``d over ``path``. Opening ``path`` directly with
    ``O_TRUNC`` would destroy the existing fixture at OPEN time, so any later
    failure -- a full disk, a broken pipe -- would leave a truncated file and
    lose a payload that may have cost a credentialled live probe to capture.
    Since the module already refuses to weaken a fixture's provenance, letting a
    failed write erase its CONTENT would protect the claim and discard the
    evidence. Either the old bytes survive intact or the new ones replace them
    whole; there is no in-between state a reader can observe.

    ``os.replace`` also cannot write THROUGH a symlink at ``path`` -- it swaps
    the directory entry itself -- so the containment guarantee holds regardless
    of the pre-check below. The explicit ``is_symlink`` check is kept so a
