"""Test helpers for consumers that need a seeded ``$KIROCREW_HOME``.

Two entry points for the same underlying behaviour:

1. ``seeded_home(fixture_name)`` — plain context manager. Use from any
   test harness (unittest, nose, hand-rolled scripts) or from production
   code that wants a throwaway populated home. Yields the ``Path`` to a
   freshly-created tempdir pre-loaded with the named fixture; restores
   the previous ``KIROCREW_HOME`` env var on exit.
2. ``seeded_home_fixture`` — pytest fixture wrapping (1). Parameterised
   over fixture name via indirect request; default is ``"empty"``.
   Only defined when pytest is importable; non-pytest consumers use
   :func:`seeded_home` directly. Auto-discovered by tests that add
   ``kiro_crew.testing.fixtures`` to their ``conftest.py`` via
   ``pytest_plugins`` or import it directly.

Rationale for two entry points: the plain context manager keeps the
helper usable outside pytest (the PRD explicitly calls out scripts and
non-pytest harnesses). The pytest fixture makes the common case a
one-liner.

SQLite deferral — see ``tests_fixtures/rich/README.md``. The helper
treats fixtures as opaque directory trees, so once the SQLite builder
lands the helper itself needs no change.

# ``pytest`` is an OPTIONAL runtime dependency. ``kiro_crew.testing`` ships in
# the runtime wheel (not ``dev_requirements``) so downstream consumers can do
# ``pip install kirocrew`` and use ``seeded_home`` from any test harness
# (unittest, nose, hand-rolled scripts). A hard ``import pytest`` at module
# level would break that contract — ``seeded_home`` itself needs no pytest,
# only ``seeded_home_fixture`` does. Lazy-import with a ``None`` sentinel,
# then guard the ``@pytest.fixture`` decorator so ``seeded_home_fixture``
# only exists when pytest is available. Pytest users get the decorator;
# non-pytest users just never see it (and ``__all__`` filters it out of the
# star-import list).

    On enter: creates a fresh temp directory, points ``KIROCREW_HOME`` at

    restores the previous ``KIROCREW_HOME`` (or unsets if it wasn't set)
    and removes the tempdir.

    Propagates ``SeedError`` from ``seed()`` — guardrails still apply (the
    helper does NOT pass ``--seed-replace`` since the tempdir is fresh
    and empty, so the non-empty guardrail cannot fire). ``fixture_name`` is
    still validated (unknown fixture, path traversal) so callers cannot
    use this helper to bypass the seed-side guardrails.
