"""Fake computer-use backend for offline tests, evals and demos.

Shipped in the runtime wheel (not dev-only), alongside
:mod:`kiro_crew.testing.fake_acp_backend`, so a downstream suite can exercise
the whole computer-use stack — MCP dispatch, governance, policy, the snapshot
index, rendering — with **no native framework, no real window, no real
application and no permission grant**.

The pytest suite registers this backend process-wide
(``register_computer_use_backend(FakeComputerUseBackend)``), which is one of the
two mechanisms that keep CI off the native path; the other is structural (no
module-scope ``CDLL`` anywhere in the package).

Its fixtures are chosen to make the security-critical branches reachable:

* **A secure field that looks innocuous.** ``role="AXTextField"`` with
  ``subrole="AXSecureTextField"`` and a POPULATED value — exactly what macOS
  reports for a real password box. A role-only check would treat it as an
  ordinary text field, so this fixture is what proves the both-attribute check
  and, through it, value redaction, input refusal and whole-window screenshot
  suppression.
* **A node whose title carries a credential-shaped literal and an
  exfiltration-shaped URL**, so a test can assert the rendered tree comes back
  masked rather than trusting that the redaction pass is wired up. The
  credential is the well-known public documentation example key — never a real
  secret.
* **A blocked app in the catalog** (a terminal), so the denylist refusal is
  reachable without inventing an app.
* **A real, decodable 1x1 JPEG** for image bytes, so the persistence and
  size-reporting paths run against genuine bytes rather than a placeholder.

Deterministic, offline, stdlib-only.
