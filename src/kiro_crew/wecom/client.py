"""WeCom AI Bot WebSocket client transport layer.

Inbound: an outbound WebSocket long-connection to WeCom receives user messages
(cmd ``aibot_msg_callback``), each carrying a server-assigned ``headers.req_id``
and a single-use ``response_url``.

Outbound: the bot streams its reply over the SAME WebSocket via
``aibot_respond_msg`` frames that replay the inbound ``req_id`` (the sole routing
key; ``body.stream.content`` is the full accumulated text, replacing the bubble
each frame).

``response_url`` is NOT part of the long-connection contract. The documented
``aibot_msg_callback`` body carries no such field — it belongs to callback-URL
mode, and to card-event payloads — so an ack that can only go out over HTTP is an
ack the user may never see. It is still parsed and kept as a last-resort fallback
for a frame that arrives with no ``req_id``, so a deployment that does supply one
is served, but nothing may DEPEND on it: out-of-band messages go through
:meth:`WeComClient.say`, which opens a fresh ``stream_id`` on the inbound
``req_id`` — a path the WS always supports.

        conversation the user has already messaged the bot in at least once — so a

        refused inbound, so a group push has no conversation it could legitimately
        answer. It arrives with group support, together with the sessions and
        allow-list that make a group safe to write to.

        This is what makes the dashboard mirror, cron delivery and threshold
        notices reachable on WeCom at all; before it, every reply had to be an
