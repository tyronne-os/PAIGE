"""WeCom inbound media: encrypted CDN download.

An ``aibot_msg_callback`` never carries bytes. An ``image`` / ``file`` / ``video``
item carries a short-lived ``url`` plus its OWN ``aeskey``, and the object at that
URL is encrypted. This module owns exactly that protocol-shaped work — download,
key decode, decrypt — so the transport deals in plaintext bytes and the shared
ingest pipeline (``messaging/attachments.py``) keeps classification, limits and
temp-file ownership channel-neutral.

**The cipher is dictated by the remote protocol, not chosen here.** WeCom's long
connection encrypts each media object with **AES-256-CBC**, PKCS#7-padded to a
32-byte multiple, using the first 16 bytes of the object's own key as the IV.

That is deliberately NOT the same scheme as Weixin's (`weixin/media.py`, AES-128-
**ECB** with a shared key), and the two must not be merged: the mode differs, the
key length differs, and WeCom's key is **per object** rather than per app. A
per-object key is the safer shape — one leaked key exposes one object — but it
also means there is no long-lived secret to cache, so the key travels with the
item and is used once.

The URL is valid for about five minutes, which is why a download failure is
reported rather than retried indefinitely: by the time a long retry would
succeed, the object is gone.

#: Unpadding with the wrong block size silently keeps or eats real bytes, so this
#: is stated rather than assumed from the cipher.

#: Hard ceiling on a single download, enforced on BYTES READ rather than on
#: ``Content-Length`` — a header is attacker-influenced and a lying one would let
#: an unbounded body through.
#:
#: It is the plaintext ceiling PLUS the padding, because what is read here is
#: CIPHERTEXT. PKCS#7 to a 32-byte multiple always adds between 1 and 32 bytes
#: (a length that is already a multiple gets a full extra block, which is what
#: makes the unpadding unambiguous), so a file at exactly the platform's maximum
#: arrives as 20 MiB + up to 32 bytes. Capping at the plaintext figure rejected
#: it before decryption — a local-only refusal of an attachment WeCom itself
#: carried, and the largest files are exactly where it bit.

    """Vet an inbound media URL for fetching and return its normalized form.

    The ``url`` arrives in the callback body, so it is platform-*supplied* but not
    platform-*guaranteed*: nothing in the frame proves the host is one WeCom
    operates. Unvetted, the fetch is a server-side request forgery primitive — a
    crafted URL (or a redirect from a legitimate one) points the gateway at an
    internal service or the cloud metadata endpoint, and the response flows on
    into the attachment pipeline. Every sibling channel vets its platform-provided
    download URL for this reason; this path was the one that did not.

    The scheme rule is this module's; the ADDRESS vet is
    :func:`link_unfurl.vet_unfurl_url`, reused rather than reimplemented. It
    resolves the host once and checks EVERY answer, so a name resolving to both a
    public and a private address is refused whichever one aiohttp would have
    picked, and its refusal set is pinned against the IANA special-purpose-range
    table by that module's own suite — which a local check would not inherit.

    Two controls the sibling channels carry are deliberately NOT here, both
    because adding them as written would cost more than it buys:

    * A CDN host allow-list, as ``discord/client.py`` keeps for its two documented
      CDN hosts and ``slack/client.py`` for ``slack.com``. WeCom documents no
      stable media-host set, so an allow-list here would be a guess, and a wrong
      guess silently drops legitimate media. The destination vet above closes the
      same class without having to name hosts.
    * A pinned resolver, the anti-rebinding mechanism in ``teams/client.py`` and
      the meetings calendar provider. This path takes an operator ``proxy``, and
      under a proxy aiohttp never resolves the target host, so the pin would go
      unconsulted on exactly the deployments that configure one. The residual is
      the rebinding window between this resolution and the socket; closing it
      needs the proxy case answered first, which is its own change.

    The proxy also splits this vet from the egress it is judging, in both
    directions, and neither direction is fixed here. Resolution happens locally
    while a proxied request is resolved and dialed by the proxy, so on
    split-horizon DNS this can REFUSE a URL the proxy would have fetched from a
    perfectly public address, and conversely it approves addresses the proxy never
    dials. Vetting what we can see is still strictly better than vetting nothing
    -- an internal target named directly is refused either way -- but a proxied
    deployment should read this as a scheme-and-destination soundness check rather
    than a guarantee about the egress path.

    Blocking: performs one ``getaddrinfo``. Call it from a worker thread.
