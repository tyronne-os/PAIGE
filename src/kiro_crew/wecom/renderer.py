"""Layer 2b -- WeCom ``Renderer``.

Maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by the base
:class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto WeCom AI-bot ``aibot_respond_msg`` WS
frames:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- a "🤔 …" placeholder stream frame.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- throttled full-text stream frames (each frame REPLACES
  the bubble content), with any trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` markup stripped (WeCom
  can't render tappable chips).
* ``on_tool_call`` -- a transient ``🔧 正在运行：{tool}…`` footer.
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- no-op: WeCom has no interactive buttons, and the
  driver only dispatches this for INTERACTIVE + a decider; WeCom runs
  decider-less (deny-by-default), so this never fires.
* ``on_compaction`` -- logged only (a mid-turn out-of-band frame would pollute
  the single answer bubble; the dispatcher surfaces threshold notices).
* ``on_done`` -- the final ``finish=true`` frame (locks the bubble), falling
  back to a one-shot ``response_url`` POST if the WS stream is
  unavailable/expired.

Dependency direction is ``wecom -> messaging`` (allowed).

        not documented to acknowledge an accepted frame at all.

        recovering or the recovery push was accepted, False when it was refused or
        there was no conversation to push into. The caller gates the TAIL on it — a

        An agentic turn doing tool work routinely runs past ten minutes, and the
