"""WeCom (企业微信) channel startup -- wired into the gateway boot.

``maybe_start_wecom`` is the single guarded entry point. When the channel is
enabled + credentialed it builds the :class:`WeComDispatcher` +
:class:`WeComTransport` + the low-level :class:`WeComClient`, wires the client's
inbound WS frames into ``transport.receive`` (authorize + normalize ->
dispatcher), then opens the outbound WebSocket via ``transport.connect()``.
Failures are logged and swallowed so a WeCom problem never takes down the
gateway.

The turn itself runs on the shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction +
tool-approval ladder + SEL audit) via the dispatcher -- no hand-rolled loop.

``warn_if_channel_uncredentialed`` is the diagnostic companion, generalized
over every collapsed-flag channel: the channel registry's
enabled-only gate never calls a factory when ``_<channel>_enabled`` is False,
so ``_start_channel_transports`` logs each channel's enabled-but-uncredentialed
skip reason through this helper at the start decision point, after
``KIROCREW_READY``. ``warn_if_wecom_uncredentialed`` remains as the
WeCom-shaped wrapper pinning the original contract.

    boolean -- and the channel registry's enabled-only gate then skips the
