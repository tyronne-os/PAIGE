"""Layer 1 -- WeCom (企业微信) as a concrete ``MessagingTransport``.

Wraps the low-level :class:`WeComClient` (WebSocket long-connection + WS
streaming reply / one-shot ``response_url`` fallback) in the channel-neutral
transport contract, so the WeCom channel rides the shared ``TurnDriver``
(credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval ladder + SEL audit) instead of a
hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``wecom -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``wecom``.

WeCom differs from Slack/Telegram in three ways, all absorbed INSIDE this
transport (the neutral layers are untouched):

* Persistent outbound WebSocket (``connect``/``disconnect`` lifecycle) -- not
  push (Slack) or long-poll (Telegram).
* The turn dispatch runs as a background task (started by the client) so the
  single WS keeps sending ACK/pong during a long streaming turn -- an inline
  await would starve the ping loop and trip a false disconnect.
* Proactive send is available (``aibot_send_msg``), but WeCom only delivers into
  a conversation the user has already written to. The transport tracks which peers
  are WARM so ``configured_targets`` can say so honestly; the SEND path gates on
  authorization only, because warmth is process-local while a mirror binding is
  persisted — after a restart warmth is unknown, not false, and the platform's own
  refusal (awaited on the ACK) is the authority on deliverability.

Security: :meth:`authorize` is **deny-by-default** and owner-only. An empty
allow-list authorizes nobody (fail closed), never everybody. The only path to
"everybody" is the explicit ``allow_all`` opt-in (config
``wecom.allow_all_users``), which still denies frames without a userid.

Two further inbound gates run in :meth:`receive`, both BEFORE a turn is
dispatched and in this order:

* **1:1 chats only** — group traffic is refused (``_chat_is_direct``). Sessions
  are keyed on ``userid``, so a group message would run inside the sender's
  private DM session and publish its history and tool output to the whole room.
* **Redelivery suppression** — WeCom may repeat a callback, and each repeat would
  run the turn again. Checked after authorization so unauthorized traffic cannot
  evict entries from the bounded window.
