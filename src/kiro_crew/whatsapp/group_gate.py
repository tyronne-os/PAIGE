"""Group participation gate: decide IF the agent may speak in a group.

Groups are opt-in: a group absent from ``whatsapp.groups`` config is invisible
to the agent (its messages are dropped before authorization). A configured
group grants one of two speaking modes:

- ``mention`` — the agent responds only when addressed: @-mentioned, or a
  participant replies to one of the agent's own messages. This is the default
  and the only mode that never speaks unprompted.
- ``rules`` — addressed messages behave as in ``mention``; in addition,
  unaddressed messages MAY produce a reply when the group entry's free-text
  ``rules`` say the agent can genuinely help. The judgment call is the model's:
  the dispatcher injects the rules plus a strict "stay silent unless the rules
  clearly apply" contract, and the turn is discarded when the model answers
  with the silence sentinel (:data:`SILENCE_SENTINEL`). A per-group cooldown
  bounds unprompted replies no matter what the model decides.
- ``off`` — configured but muted (kept so its entry, rules and history stay).

Group members other than the operator get **answer-only** treatment
regardless of mode: the verdict marks whether the sender may steer the
session (commands like /new) — only the operator may.

This module is pure decision logic (no I/O, no neonize types) so the whole
matrix is unit-testable; the transport feeds it normalized values.

Group JIDs are keyed through :func:`normalize_jid` on BOTH sides -- the config
entries when they are indexed, and the lookup value -- so the same group hashes
to the same key no matter which path produced it. ``jids`` is pure string logic
with no dependencies, so importing it here keeps this module's own I/O-free
property intact.
