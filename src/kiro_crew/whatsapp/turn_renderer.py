"""Turn rendering for the WhatsApp channel.

The reply STREAMS: the first bubble is sent as soon as there is something worth
reading, then edited in place as more text arrives, and a new bubble is opened
when the text outgrows one message. The Web protocol does expose an edit (the
Business Cloud API does not), which is why this channel can do what iMessage and
Weixin cannot.

Two things bound it, and both are about the operator's own phone number rather
than about looking tidy:

- **A throttle, not a per-token edit.** Every edit is a full end-to-end encrypted
  send to every device of every participant. neonize's own example edits once per
  character; doing that from a personal account is exactly the traffic pattern
  that gets a number rate-limited or banned. Edits are coalesced to at most one
  per :data:`_EDIT_INTERVAL_S`, single-flight, keeping only the newest pending
  text: a burst of chunks costs one edit, not one each.
- **The edit window.** WhatsApp accepts an edit for ``client.EDIT_WINDOW_S``
  after the original send and then refuses. A turn that runs longer stops editing
  and seals, so a long agent run degrades to sequential bubbles instead of
  silently dropping its own progress.

While the turn runs it also holds the "composing" presence.

Channel-specific twists:

- Delivery goes through ``WhatsAppTransport.send_message`` rather than the raw
  client, so every sent chunk's ID lands in the echo tracker atomically.
- An unprompted rules-mode group turn whose entire answer is the silence
  sentinel (``group_gate.SILENCE_SENTINEL``) is suppressed: nothing is
  delivered, and ``suppressed`` tells the dispatcher not to start the group
  cooldown.

Dependency direction is ``whatsapp -> messaging`` (allowed).
