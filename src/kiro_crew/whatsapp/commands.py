"""WhatsApp command parsing.

The shipped surface is deliberately small, because WhatsApp is a phone-first
surface with no slash-command registry, no autocomplete and no buttons
(``max_buttons=0``): every command has to be worth remembering by hand.

  /new (or /start)   : start a fresh session (advances the generation counter)
  /compact           : trigger context compaction
  /help              : list the commands
  /status            : runtime summary (is it alive, is it working)
  /stop (or /cancel) : abort the running turn and clear the queue

Each row's reason for existing is in :data:`COMMANDS`. Commands are matched
against the WHOLE message, not as a prefix: ``whatsapp/transport.py`` drops a
non-operator group message as soon as :func:`parse_command` is truthy, so a
prefix match would start swallowing ordinary group chatter that merely opens
with a slash.

Deliberately NOT ported from Slack. **Slack's command surface is not the parity
target**, and the omissions below are a design position rather than a backlog.
Slack carries its own YOLO grant, its own second trust store on top of the
session's approval policy, and its own redirect seam that mirrors dashboard
replies into the chat. Each is state that already exists somewhere else, and a
per-channel copy is a second place the same thing is written, free to drift from
the first. This channel keeps ONE of each: trust is the session's own approval
policy (``sessions.set_approval_policy``), and the dashboard owns settings.

So a command lands here only when it needs no duplicate state, and each of these
either needs a capability this channel does not have, crosses a trust boundary a
phone must not, or would grow a second settings surface:

- ``/model``: the picker is a list of the advertised models. With no buttons it
  would degrade to a numbered text list, and the digits ``1``/``2``/``3``
  already mean "answer the pending tool approval" on this channel
  (``messaging/approval.py``), so the two grammars would collide.
- ``/yolo``: a blanket auto-approve grant. The per-tool prompt is already
  answerable by typing a digit, and a grant typed on a phone widens what a
  borrowed or unlocked handset can do on the operator's machine.
- ``/dashboard`` and ``/link-to-dashboard``: both mint a presigned login link.
  A link pasted into a WhatsApp chat lands on every linked device and in the
  account's own message history, none of which this process controls.
- ``/link`` and ``/unlink``: mirror dashboard replies into the chat, which
  needs ``supports_session_resume``; this channel derives its session key from
  the chat JID and declares it ``False``.
- ``/voice``: the CAPABILITY exists here (``files_outbound=True``, and
  ``client.send_voice_bytes`` sends a real push-to-talk note), so the reason is
  not a missing primitive. Slack's ``/voice`` is a settings SURFACE: a modal plus
  per-session bang controls for voice, engine, rate and pitch. Per-channel copies
  of a settings surface are what this channel deliberately does not grow, because
  each one becomes a second place the same preference is written and drifts from
  the dashboard's. Voice configuration belongs in Settings, once.
- ``/sessions``: a list of recent session titles is a disclosure surface, and
  it needs the paging and rich blocks this channel has neither of.
- ``/title``: names a thread; ``threads=False`` here.
- ``/agent``, ``/ta`` and ``/project``: they repoint the agent and its
  discovery root. That is setup, it belongs to the dashboard, and there is no
  name list on this surface to pick from.
- ``/users``, ``/channels``, ``/config`` and ``/allowlist``: they edit the very
  access control that admits the sender. ``is_operator`` is deliberately
  narrower than ``dm_policy`` here, so the chat must not be able to widen it.
- ``/restart``: takes the gateway down. There is no confirmation affordance on
  this surface, so a mistap costs the operator their agent.
- ``/queue <msg>`` and ``/steer <msg>``: prefix directives by construction,
  which is exactly the shape this channel refuses. The busy path already
  steers when the provider supports it.

Per-conversation generation + awaiting-compact state lives in the shared
``messaging.conversation.ConversationState`` (re-exported so callers can
import it from this module, mirroring ``weixin.commands``).
