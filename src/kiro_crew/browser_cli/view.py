"""Supervises ``playwright-cli show``, the CLI's own dashboard, over loopback.

``show --port`` is a blocking HTTP server, so it is a long-lived supervised
child with its own lifecycle, not a call that returns a result. The dashboard it
serves carries the live viewport, the tab bar, and **full remote mouse and
keyboard input** into a browser that holds the operator's logged-in sessions.

Three properties are load-bearing; each was established by running the CLI, and
getting any of them wrong presents as a broken feature rather than as an error:

1. **Bind explicitly to ``127.0.0.1``.** The default listener is IPv6-only, so
   ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`` is unreachable and an iframe pointed there gets
   a connection failure while the server is running fine.
2. **Health is "any HTTP response", never "200".** ``/`` answers ``302``.
3. **Never ``--host 0.0.0.0``.** That would publish an interactive
   remote-input browser view, holding live logins, to the whole network. This
   module takes no host parameter at all, so there is no argument through which
   a caller could ask for a non-loopback bind.

The port is chosen by bind-probe rather than hardcoded: a fixed port collides
with whatever else the operator runs, and the collision would surface as an
unexplained dead panel. An operator who NEEDS predictability — the dashboard
viewed through an SSH tunnel that forwards a fixed set of ports — can pin the
public port via ``dashboard.browser_view_port``. The pin is never handed to
the child: this module claims the pinned port itself with a bound listener it
keeps holding (an atomic ownership proof, so the deterministic, operator-named
port is race-free) and relays byte-for-byte to the child's own ephemeral port.
The child's OS-assigned port keeps the same advisory bind window as the
unpinned path — unpredictable and loopback-local. Both the relay and the
child bind loopback only.
