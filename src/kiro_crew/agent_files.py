"""Canonical filenames of the agent configs KiroCrew generates.

Single source of truth for the on-disk names KiroCrew writes into
``~/.kiro/agents/`` (kiro specs). This is a **leaf module** (no intra-package
imports) so both
``agent.py`` (which writes these files) and ``browser/setup.py`` (whose
Playwright convergence sweep must touch only KiroCrew-owned files) can import it
without an import cycle — ``agent.py`` imports ``converge_playwright_servers``
from ``browser/setup.py``, so ``browser/setup.py`` cannot import ``agent.py``.

Keeping the names here — rather than duplicating them as a literal in each
consumer — means adding a new managed agent spec is a one-line change in ONE
place: add its filename to ``OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`` and every consumer
(including the boot-time self-heal sweep) picks it up.

#   * ``kirocrew-lite.json`` — the cheap background agent (auto-titles,

# The remaining OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES entries are deliberately excluded: their
