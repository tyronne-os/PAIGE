    Two callers, one shape: a corpus read from disk, followed by rows that MAY
    already be in it.

    A fork rebuild appends the slot's unflushed tail onto a freshly read disk
    corpus. "Unflushed" was decided against an EARLIER read, so a save landing
    between the two reads leaves those rows in both lists.

    ``read_messages_chained_full`` concatenates a key's rotated archive with its
    live file. Rotation writes the archive first and rewrites the live file's head
    second, so a crash between those two steps leaves the rotated rows in both
    files permanently.

    In both cases appending blind duplicates rows, and a duplicated row is not
    cosmetic here: this is the index space pagination cursors and fork indices
    resolve against, so one extra row shifts every index above it.

    Rows are matched by their stable id (``meta.mid``) when BOTH carry one. That
    id is what ``history`` assigns per row, so it is the only identity that
    cannot collide. Without it the fallback requires ``(ts, role, content)`` to
    all match: ``(ts, role)`` alone is a spot-check elsewhere, but here a match
    DELETES a row, and two distinct rows can share a second and a role (the same
    speaker twice inside one second, or two processes stamping the same ts), so
    dropping on that alone would remove a genuinely unpersisted message. The
    longest overlap wins, so a partially-written duplication is handled as well as
    a whole one: both producers persist a PREFIX, never an interior slice.
