"""Session cleanup watchdog — a minimal dispatcher for periodic cleanup hooks.

The session cleanup loop delegates policy hooks (idle expiry, orphaned-MCP
cleanup, RSS-based recycling, stuck-turn detection, and background drain
reaping) to this thin container. Process and filesystem sweeps remain directly
coordinated by the cleanup service.

Each hook is a self-contained :class:`CleanupHook` — the *execution* half of a
Command. Each hook carries its own try/except internally, so
:meth:`SessionWatchdog.tick` performs no error handling of its own beyond a
debug-level backstop. This is deliberate: a blanket ``logger.exception`` here
would *promote* the severity of failures that the hooks swallow silently, which
would be an observable behaviour change. The container is stateless and
config-free.

This intentionally does NOT model the *decision* half (``evaluate() -> Verdict``).
The cleanup functions fuse find-and-act (e.g. idle expiry both selects idle
sessions and resets them in place).
