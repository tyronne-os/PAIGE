"""systemd ``--user`` template unit for pods — generated, not shipped.

The unit's ``ExecStart`` re-enters a ``kirocrew`` binary as ``kirocrew pod _run
%i``, so the boot logic lives in Python (see :func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.boot`)
and nothing is shipped outside the package. The template can only name ONE
binary for every instance, so each pod additionally gets a per-instance drop-in
(:func:`install_dropin`) pinning ``ExecStart`` to its OWN checkout's ``kirocrew``
— without it a pod runs whichever build ``pod install`` resolved rather than the
worktree it exists to test.

The unit deliberately has **no ``ExecStopPost`` teardown hook**. systemd runs
``ExecStopPost`` before the final kill of the unit's cgroup, so a hook that
deleted the pod's isolated HOME raced the pod's own surviving subprocesses (which
recreated the directory by reopening their audit log in append mode), and it also
fired on the stop half of a ``Restart=``, restarting the pod onto a home that no
longer held its sessions or config. Reclamation therefore belongs to
:func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.stop_pod`, which runs it after the service is
confirmed down and its process tree has drained; ``pod ls`` reports the HOMEs left
by a pod that went away without a ``down``.

# booted through that build regardless of which checkout it was pinned to, and a

# the worktree's own ``boot`` — which does honour it — never ran.

# that pod to its checkout without touching the shared template. The empty
# ``ExecStart=`` is required: for a ``Type=simple`` unit the directive is a list,
# and a second value would append a command rather than replace the template's.
