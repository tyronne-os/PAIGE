def _canonical_override(raw: str) -> Path:
    """An operator-supplied path override, anchored so every reader agrees.

    ``expanduser`` then ``abspath``. The second half is the load-bearing one: a
    RELATIVE override resolves against the reading process's working directory,
    and the two processes that must agree on a pod plane do not share one. The CLI
    runs from wherever the operator invoked it; the service-manager-booted gateway
    runs from whatever the unit specifies, and the pod unit deliberately sets no
    ``WorkingDirectory`` (see ``pod/unit.py``), so systemd hands it ``/``. With the
    value carried through verbatim, ``KIROCREW_POD_ROOT=tmp/pods`` therefore named
    ``$PWD/tmp/pods`` to the CLI and ``/tmp/pods`` to the gateway -- two different
    directories under one name.

    That split is a CREDENTIAL leak, not merely a confusing path. ``pod down``
    reclaims the tree the CLI resolves, while the pod's kiro-cli child mints its
    MCP OAuth grants under the tree the GATEWAY resolved (``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``,
    derived from ``pod_root``), so teardown swept a directory the grants were never
    in and they outlived the pod on the real machine -- the exact durable
    machine-level grant writer the pod-scoping work exists to prevent.

    Anchored HERE, at the producer, because this is the one place both sides come
    from: :meth:`PodConfig.load` reads it and :func:`environment_vars` serialises
    what ``load`` resolved, so pinning it once makes the unit carry an absolute
    path and every consumer inherit the agreement. Fixing it in a consumer instead
    would leave each new reader to re-derive the rule.

    ``abspath`` rather than ``Path.resolve()``, deliberately. Both would close the
    relative case; ``resolve()`` additionally rewrites the operator's symlink
    spelling, which is not the defect (two spellings of one directory still name
    one inode, so teardown scope is unaffected) and which would silently change
    the value pinned into a unit -- on macOS every ``/tmp/...`` plane becomes
    ``/private/tmp/...``. ``abspath`` normalises ``.``/``..`` and anchors to the
    CWD without touching links, and is the same primitive
    ``security._resolved_env_root`` falls back to.

    Only an OVERRIDE is anchored; a built-in default is already ``$HOME``-rooted
    and is left exactly as it was, which is what keeps :func:`environment_vars`
    emitting ``{}`` for an all-defaults plane on a host whose ``$HOME`` is a link.
