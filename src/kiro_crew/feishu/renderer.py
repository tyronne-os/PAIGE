"""Layer 2b -- Feishu ``Renderer``.

Maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream onto a single Feishu REST
reply anchored to the inbound message_id:

* ``on_turn_start``   -- no-op (no streaming placeholder in v1).
* ``on_text_chunk``   -- buffers text; a trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` trailer
  becomes a numbered text list (Feishu renders no tappable chips).
* ``on_tool_call``    -- updates a transient tool-footer in the buffer.
* ``on_prompt_choice``-- no-op: Feishu has no interactive buttons in v1
  (the driver only dispatches this for INTERACTIVE + a decider, and
  FeishuDispatcher runs decider-less).
* ``on_compaction``   -- logged only (threshold notices go post-turn).
* ``on_done``         -- sends the complete accumulated text as one reply.
* ``close``           -- idempotent finalisation (sends on error if needed).

Dependency direction is ``feishu -> messaging`` (allowed).
