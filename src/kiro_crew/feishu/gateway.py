"""Feishu (Lark/飞书) channel startup -- wired into the gateway boot.

``maybe_start_feishu`` is the single guarded entry point.  When the channel
is enabled + credentialed it builds the :class:`FeishuDispatcher` +
:class:`FeishuTransport` + the low-level :class:`LarkClient`, wires the
client's inbound WS frames into ``transport.receive`` (authorise + normalise
-> dispatcher), then opens the WebSocket via ``transport.connect()``.
Failures are logged and swallowed so a Feishu problem never takes down the
gateway.

The turn itself runs on the shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction
+ tool-approval ladder + SEL audit) via the dispatcher -- no hand-rolled loop.
