"""Background-session runtime boundary for :mod:`kiro_crew.session`.

The session manager has two background execution shapes:

* a persistent ``BACKGROUND_KEY`` provider stored in the owner's live-session
  registry, used by provider backends that cannot share an ``AcpRuntime``; and
* a multiplexed runtime that gives each caller an ephemeral session handle.

This module owns the latter runtime's slot, lock, and draining list while using
the owner facade for registry and lifecycle operations.  It deliberately does
not import ``kiro_crew.session`` at runtime: the facade injects module-level
compatibility seams through :class:`BackgroundRuntimeDeps`.
