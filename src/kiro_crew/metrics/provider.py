"""Telemetry provider wiring — builds the process-global ``MetricsRecorder``.

Consent + local-first:
  * ``telemetry.enabled`` defaults **False**. When off, ``get_recorder()`` returns
    a no-op recorder, so adding metric call sites is a zero-runtime-effect change
    until a host opts in (mirrors the ``mcp_gateway.enabled`` /
    ``skills.lazy_load`` default-off convention).
  * Easy opt-in: set ``telemetry.enabled: true`` in ``~/.kiro/crew/config.json``
    OR export the ``KIROCREW_TELEMETRY`` env var (``1``/``true``/``on`` to enable,
    ``0``/``false``/``off`` to force-disable). The env var overrides the config
    flag and gates LOCAL collection only — it never enables network egress.
  * Opting in does NOT require a restart. The recorder is process-global and
    memoized, but ``get_recorder()`` re-resolves consent on a rate-limited window
    (``_CONSENT_RECHECK_SECS``) and rebuilds when it moved — so a config edit from
    the CLI, an editor, or another process starts (or stops) collection on its own.
    A caller that changed the setting itself can call ``shutdown()`` to apply it on
    the very next metric instead of waiting out the window.
  * When on, a ``PeriodicExportingMetricReader`` drains aggregated metrics to the
    local JSONL exporter under ``~/.kiro/crew/metrics``. Nothing egresses the host.
  * Remote / OTLP egress is a separate opt-in exporter (deferred; not wired here).

OSS-CLEAN: depends only on ``opentelemetry`` (Apache-2.0 / CNCF) + the stdlib +
the first-party config loader and metrics helpers. No Amazon-internal imports.

This module is imported lazily (on the first ``get_recorder()`` call), never
during ``config.loader``'s import chain, so its top-level ``config.loader``
import cannot form a cycle. Callers that reach it from inside that chain (e.g.
``acp.client``) MUST import ``get_recorder`` lazily — see the ``# circular
import`` note there.

    A resource attribute becomes a LABEL on every series this process exports,
    which cuts both ways: it is the only place fleet-level GROUP BYs can come
    from, and any unbounded value here multiplies every instrument's series
    count. So every attribute is a closed set or explicitly clamped, and every
    probe fails soft -- a failed read omits the attribute rather than losing
    telemetry or inventing a value.

    ``service.instance.id`` is set EXPLICITLY to the persisted install id
    rather than left to the SDK, whose default identifies a PROCESS: a fresh
    UUID per restart starts a brand-new series set every time -- fast,
    pure-cost growth on desktops, which restart constantly -- and it severs
    "this install over time" across restarts. Machines must still be separable
    (a fleet percentile is computed ACROSS series; identical labels would
    collide every host into one series), which is why the id exists at all.
    It is a random UUID persisted on disk, deliberately NOT derived from
    hostname or username, which on a corporate desktop routinely embed the
    employee's alias.

    ``process.pid`` (OTel semconv) carries the PROCESS identity SEPARATELY:
    one install runs several telemetry-enabled processes at once (the gateway
    plus spawned agents/apps each build their own recorder -- the reason the
    local exporter shards per PID), and with an install-scoped resource alone
    their per-process gauges and cumulative counters would interleave into one
    corrupted series at any OTLP backend. The pid makes each process its own
    resource; the install id groups them back together for fleet questions
    (distinct devices, per-install rollups). PID reuse across restarts reads
    as an ordinary counter reset downstream.

    This function only ever READS the install id (``create=False``: one stat
    + a 32-byte read, the same class as the config fingerprint check). The
    single WRITE that can create it lives in :func:`_build_recorder`'s live
    branch, immediately before this call, so a resource is labelled from the
    very first export rather than acquiring its identity mid-life -- a
    mid-life resource swap reads downstream as a brand-new series set, which
    is a worse outcome than the ~1ms it would save. Keeping the mint in the
    build path rather than in a rebuild worker is also what lets this module
    hold no backfill state at all. Residual, accepted: omitting the key does
    NOT yield an unlabelled resource -- the SDK substitutes its own
    per-process UUID (measured: a dashed 36-char uuid4, versus our 32-char
    hex) -- so a host whose mint FAILS (unwritable data dir) falls back to
    exactly the per-restart series churn this attribute exists to prevent.
    That is the cost of a broken data dir, not of a fresh install: minting
    before the first build means there is no startup window in which the
    substitute can reach an export at all. Local shards stay unambiguous
    either way, because the exporter stamps per-process identity on every
    line.

    ``service.version`` is the release-clamped build version
    (:func:`beacon.release`, the same clamp the beacon ships). Without it
    nothing in a payload identifies the build that produced it, so
    release-over-release comparison degenerates to comparing time ranges --
    which a gradual rollout muddies, since both versions report into the same
    buckets. With the label it is a GROUP BY. The clamp matters as much as the
    field: a raw dev/nightly ``__version__`` carries a per-build stamp, so an
    unclamped value would mint a new series set per build.

    The environment attributes (``os.type``, ``host.arch``,
    ``process.runtime.name``/``version``) follow the OTel semantic conventions
    and are CLOSED sets: readings outside the known values fold to
    :data:`_ATTR_OTHER`, and the runtime version is clamped to ``major.minor``
    (the patch level adds cardinality without answering anything the minor
    does not -- the beacon's rule). ``host.cpu.logical_count`` is what lets
    ``kirocrew.process.cpu.seconds`` be normalized into a machine percentage
    downstream: the core count exists only client-side, so it must travel
    with the data.

    Deliberately absent:

      * the distribution channel. The beacon's data-minimization pass REMOVED
        its channel field because channel sharply narrows the crowd a stable id
        hides in (a nightly population is small by definition). Stamping it on
        every metric payload would quietly undo that decision; re-adding it is
        a consent-inventory question, not a code convenience.
      * an install type (desktop / cli / remote-gateway). There is no reliable
        detection today; a guessed label would be confidently wrong.

    "nothing is exported" while metrics leave the machine: two answers to one

    RAISES when posture cannot be established, and that is deliberate: the two

    local-only.

    A provider that does not IMPLEMENT the method is a different case and answers
    ``False``, not a raise. Providers are matched structurally with no inherited

    is a KNOWN answer — it contributes no destination through this seam, exactly
