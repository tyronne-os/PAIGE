"""The per-turn instrument family, emitted for every surface.

``kirocrew.turn.duration`` (histogram) plus the turn's own usage —
``kirocrew.turn.tokens`` (counter, ``direction`` attr) and the two billing
histograms ``kirocrew.turn.credits`` / ``kirocrew.turn.cost_usd``. All four are
emitted from the same boundary about the same turn, so latency, volume and spend
describe one population and can be read against each other.

The duration instrument powers two readings on the Telemetry page: turn latency
(p50/p90) and fault rate (the share of turns whose outcome is not ``ok``).
Both are only as honest as the population they sample, which is why this
module exists at all.

**Why this is not in ``chat_runner``.** An emit beside the dashboard turn
loop is structurally reachable from exactly one
surface: a cron job, a heartbeat task, a memory consolidation pass, a subagent,
a task-runner step, a workflow stage and every messaging channel each run agent
turns that never pass through that loop, so none of them produced a sample. The
consequence is worse than a gap, because an absent sample does not read as
absent: a background surface that is slow, stalling or erroring contributed
nothing, so the page rendered the interactive median and called it the system's
health. There was also no way to see how many background turns had run at all.

**The shared boundary is the usage row, not the ACP turn.** The obvious
candidate was ``acp/session_handle.py::SessionHandle._run_turn``, which every
ACP-backed surface really does cross. It was rejected: the handle knows only its
ACP ``sessionId``, not the Kiro Crew session key this metric must group by, and
an ``AcpClient``-backed session (the claude_code backend) never reaches it at
all. ``persist_token_record_async`` is the boundary that actually fits — every
surface already calls it once per turn at ``EVENT_COMPLETE``, and it already
receives the session key, the measured ``elapsed_ms`` and the turn's usage. So
the metric is emitted where the row is written, and the two can never disagree
about one turn.

**Outcome is passed in, never guessed.** The ``event`` argument those callers
pass is heterogeneous (an ``LLMEvent`` from the chat path, a bare ``TurnUsage``
from the helper sites), so a stop reason cannot be read off it reliably. Each
surface states its own outcome instead, and ``test_turn_duration_recorded.py``
holds every call site to that. Defaulting to ``ok`` would have been the harmful
alternative: it would bury exactly the failing background turns the metric is
being widened to expose.

    Single source of truth shared by every surface's emit and by the unit tests,
    so the mapping cannot drift from what the tests assert. Every label this
    metric can carry is returned from HERE, which is what lets
    ``test_telemetry_handler``'s drift gate harvest them by AST and prove each
    one is classified by the fault aggregator.

    ``None`` and ``""`` both mean a clean turn: the acp path leaves
    ``event.stop_reason`` unset on a normal completion, so this function must not
    read absence as failure. "This surface had no stop reason to GIVE" is a
    different statement, and it is not expressible here — a caller holding a bare
    ``TurnUsage`` cannot distinguish its missing attribute from a clean ``None``
    at this layer, so it passes :data:`OUTCOME_UNCLASSIFIED` itself.

    The two watchdog stop reasons are distinct outcomes, not ``error``: a
    stall-recovery turn is re-driven in place (its budget/outcome is tracked by
    ``kirocrew.watchdog.recovery.outcome``), so folding it into ``error`` would
    make the fault rate count every recovered stall as a fault AND hide the
    stall population the watchdog work exists to measure. Checked BEFORE the
    ``timeout`` substring so a stall never misclassifies.

    ``exhausted`` marks a stall turn whose recovery budget is already spent: the
    slot dies with "start a new chat", so the turn labels ``stall_exhausted`` — a
    terminal fault to the aggregator — keeping the recovered-stall exclusion
    from hiding dead sessions while ``fault_rate`` stays a single-series
    computation. Only the dashboard turn loop maintains such a budget; a
    background surface has no recovery loop, so it never passes this.

    A user cancel is its own outcome, NOT ``error``. Folding it into the
    error branch would put every press of Stop into the ``fault_rate``
    numerator: the one turn outcome the operator causes deliberately would be
    reported as the system failing. It is matched by EXACT equality against
    :data:`_STOP_CANCELLED` rather than a substring, because the watchdog's
    unacked-cancel reason (``"error: cancel unacked"``) is a genuine fault and

    ``duration_ms`` is the provider-reported duration and ``elapsed_ms`` the
    locally measured wall clock; the first non-zero wins. Both are needed
    because the acp provider ALWAYS reports ``TurnUsage.duration_ms == 0``
    (nothing in the codebase assigns it — only claude_code fills it in), so a
    provider-only value silently skipped the emit for effectively all traffic
    and left turn latency / fault rate / throughput reading a flat 0.

    A still-zero duration skips the emit deliberately: an absent sample reads as
    "no data" on the Telemetry page, whereas a recorded 0 would render as a
    plausible-looking 0ms p50 — the very symptom that guard's misuse caused.

    ``session_source`` is derived with
    :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.link.telemetry_channel_of`, which exists for
    exactly this question ("who paid this cost") and returns a bounded label:
    the transport namespace for a channel key, a local label for the rest,

    ``validation.infer_use_case``, whose output also gates an artifact check
    (``handlers/artifacts.py``) — a metric must not be the reason an
    authorization-adjacent mapping grows a case.

    Caveat on what the wall clock measures: ``elapsed_ms`` runs from the start
    of the turn, so a turn parked on an interactive tool-approval prompt counts
    the operator's thinking time as turn duration. There is no finer-grained
    source on the acp path (the provider reports nothing at all), so this is the
    honest maximum available — but it means the histogram is "turn wall-clock",
    not pure model latency, and a high p90 can mean slow approvals rather than a
    slow model.

    ``model`` / ``provider`` ride along so latency can be read per model instead
    of as one pooled distribution over every model the host ran — a pool whose
    p90 moves when the model MIX moves and not when anything got slower. Both
    are omitted when empty rather than sent as ``""``, so a caller that cannot
    name them contributes to the un-split series instead of minting an
    empty-string label. See :func:`_model_attrs` for the cardinality argument.
