"""``kirocrew.session.duration`` + ``kirocrew.session.started``.

How long a session lives, and why it ended. Together they answer questions the
existing session instruments cannot: ``kirocrew.session.startup.duration``
measures the cold start of the agent PROCESS, and
``kirocrew.session.idle_expired`` counts one specific teardown cause, but
nothing recorded how long a session actually lasted or how its lifetimes split
across the ways a session can end.

**Why the reason is passed in, never derived.** There is no single teardown
function. ``session_lifecycle.SessionLifecycleService`` exposes six distinct end
paths -- ``reset``, ``remove``, ``remove_if_unclaimed``, ``destroy``,
``discard_conversation`` and ``close_all`` -- and each pops the registry itself
rather than delegating to a shared funnel. Two more paths pop it WITHOUT going
through any of those: ``retire_kiro_identity_sessions`` (an identity change
retires every idle process on the old account) and
``CompactionCoordinator._recycle_held`` (context overflow replaces the provider
in place). So each path states its own reason, the same contract
``metrics/turns.py`` holds its callers to.

``reset`` is the widest of them: the idle sweep and a slot reset both reach
teardown through it, so ``end_reason=reset`` is a path label, not a cause. That
is deliberate -- the finer causes behind it are already counted separately
(``kirocrew.session.idle_expired``, ``kirocrew.watchdog.recovery.outcome``), and
a metric must not be the reason a lifecycle signature every surface calls grows
a parameter. The identity retire and the compaction recycle are NOT inside it and
carry their own labels, because a metric that reported them as ``reset`` would be
claiming a teardown route they never take.

**Why a breadcrumb on disk.** A start time held only in memory dies with the
process, which is exactly the population most worth measuring: a session that
ends because the gateway crashed never runs any teardown path, so it would
contribute no sample at all and the histogram would describe only orderly
shutdowns. Each start therefore drops one small JSON file under
``<data home>/metrics/open-sessions/``. The clean path does NOT read that file --
it takes the start time from the in-memory table, so an end can account for
itself in the same tick as the registry removal it reports -- it only unlinks it.
Whatever is still there at the next boot belongs to a session that never ended
cleanly, so :func:`backfill_crashed_sessions` reads it, emits it as
``end_reason=crashed`` and unlinks it. The crumb is written only while telemetry
consent is in force, since it exists solely to feed an instrument that is a no-op
without it.

**No crumb syscall runs on the event loop.** Every path that touches a crumb
file -- the start's write, the end's unlink, a rolled-back start's discard and
the boot backfill's scan -- does it on a worker thread. A single ``unlink`` looks
too small to bother with until the data home is slow or network-backed, at which
point that one syscall parks every gateway task behind whichever session happens
to be closing: teardown runs on the paths a person is waiting on (closing a tab,
resetting a slot, shutting the gateway down), so the stall is felt as the whole
gateway freezing rather than as a metrics problem. Each hop is AWAITED rather
than queued, for the reason :func:`_unlink_generations` gives at length.

**Why not the transcript's existing close marker.** A transcript's metadata line
already carries ``created_at``, and the dashboard tab-close path stamps
``closed`` / ``closed_at`` beside it. Neither substitutes for the crumb. That
stamp is written by the dashboard close path ALONE, so a channel, cron, subagent
or task-runner session never gets one; and its ABSENCE is ambiguous by
construction -- a transcript with no ``closed`` is equally a crashed session, a
live-but-idle one, and one that was never a dashboard tab. There is no positive
crash flag on disk today, which is what the crumb supplies, for every surface.
Boot has no session sweep to piggyback on either: the restore path is seed-driven
from ``open_slots.json`` and never walks the transcript directory.

**Why the clean path consumes the crumb rather than reading it.** The
popped registry entry does carry an epoch ``created_at``, so a clean end could
compute its own duration without touching disk. It deliberately does not, for two
reasons. The clean and crashed paths must consume the SAME record or they
double-count: a crumb left behind by a clean end is indistinguishable at the next
boot from one left by a crash, and would be emitted a second time as
``crashed``. And that field is RESET when a provider is recycled in place, so it
measures the provider's age rather than the session's residency in the registry.

That unlink is what makes the accounting exact. A crumb is consumed at most
once, so the six teardown paths cannot double-count a session between them (the
idle sweep's ``reset`` is a real instance of this: the sweep and the path it
calls both sit on the same session), and a backfilled session cannot be counted
again on the boot after that.

**Where a crashed session's END time comes from.** The crumb is written once and
never rewritten, so its own mtime is its start. The session's transcript
(``<data home>/sessions/<stem>.jsonl``) is appended to as the conversation runs,
so its mtime is the last moment the session was observably alive -- the honest
maximum available after the fact. A session with no transcript on disk (a
subagent leaves only a replay log) yields no end time, so it is unlinked without
an emit rather than recorded as a plausible-looking zero: an absent sample reads
as "no data", a zero renders as a real 0ms lifetime.

Telemetry must never break the instrumented path, so every function here
swallows its failures after a debug log, and every attribute value is a
constant from the closed enums below.

    """Emit *session_key*'s lifetime; never raises.

    **The pop and the sample stay in the same tick as the registry removal they
    report; only the unlink leaves it.** The start time is popped from the
    in-memory table and the histogram recorded in memory, both BEFORE this
    function's single suspension point -- so a teardown path still accounts for
    its session immediately after its ``_sessions.pop`` and before anything can
    interleave. The earlier version read the crumb off disk here, which forced the
    call to the end of teardown -- and a replacement session registering under the
    same key during those awaits then had its crumb consumed by its predecessor's
    teardown.

    Popping the table entry is also the double-count defence: the teardown paths
    are not mutually exclusive (the idle sweep calls ``reset``), so whichever
    reaches the session first is the one that records it, and a second call finds
    nothing.

    **Why the unlink is awaited off the loop rather than run inline.** Inline, it
    is one syscall against the data home on the event loop, which is nothing until
    that home is slow or network-backed and every gateway task parks behind one
    closing session. Queued fire-and-forget, it is dropped exactly when it matters
    -- see :func:`_unlink_generations`. Awaiting a worker hop is the only shape
    that is both off the loop and never dropped, and it is the shape
    :func:`record_session_started` already uses for the matching write. Callers
    hold the session registry lock across the await, so no start, end or successor
    can interleave with it either.

    **The sample is emitted BEFORE the hop, the opposite of the start path's
    counter, because the risks are opposite.** A cancelled start is rolled back
    and never existed, so counting it before its cancellable point would report a
    session that never was. An end cannot be rolled back -- the pop has already
    consumed the only record of this generation -- so the session HAS ended
    whatever happens next. Emitting first is therefore what keeps the sample when
    the await is cancelled, and it measures the lifetime at the pop rather than a
    worker round-trip later.

    **A cancellation at the hop is ABSORBED, not propagated, and that is what
    makes the new suspension point safe to give a teardown.** The registry pop is
    the caller's point of no return: past it the session is gone from the registry
    and only the caller's remaining cleanup can finish the job -- ``destroy``
    deletes the session-map entry in a ``finally`` BELOW this call, and
    ``discard_conversation`` and ``reset`` clear the resume SID on the line after
    the lock. Raising here would exit those callers before that cleanup, leaving a
    destroyed session's mapping behind for the next boot to resume: a cancellation
    cannot undo a teardown, it can only leave it half done, so the correct answer
    is to let the teardown finish. **The cancellation is genuinely DISCARDED, not
    deferred**: a swallowed ``CancelledError`` is not re-delivered by asyncio, so the
    caller runs to completion unless something cancels it again. That is the intended
    outcome rather than a side effect -- finishing a teardown that has already popped
    is what the callers' ``finally`` blocks exist for -- and it is what
    ``test_a_cancelled_end_lets_its_callers_post_pop_cleanup_run`` pins. The crumb is
    not at risk either way: :func:`_unlink_generations` shields its hop, so the
    executor still runs the unlink.

    Takes no lock across the hop, and must not take ``_crumb_io_lock`` at all:
    worker threads hold that across filesystem latency, so waiting on it here
    would park the loop on the very syscall this moved off it. No lock is needed
    either -- the backfill skips every crumb whose owner is live, so it never looks
    at one this process wrote, and an in-flight writer for this key self-corrects
    by re-checking the generation this function has just popped.

    **The hop is AWAITED, not queued, and that distinction is the whole reason the
    unlink stayed on the loop for as long as it did.**
    ``shutdown_maintenance_executor`` drains with ``cancel_futures=True``, so a
    fire-and-forget unlink is dropped at ``close_all`` -- exactly when teardown is
    heaviest -- and the crumb of a cleanly ended session then survives to the next
    boot to be back-filled as ``crashed``. A dropped unlink is worse than a slow
    one, because it manufactures a failure in the one population this instrument
    exists to measure. Awaiting keeps the syscall off the loop without ever
    dropping it, and the caller holds the session registry lock across it, so
    nothing can interleave either.

    **Cancelling the await must neither drop the unlink nor put it back on the
    loop, and a shielded bare executor future is the only shape that does both.**
    Three rounds of review narrowed this to one line, so the reasoning is recorded
    in full.

    ``asyncio.to_thread`` submits before it suspends, but submitted is not started:
    on a saturated executor the work item is still queued, and cancelling the await
    reaches the underlying ``concurrent.futures.Future`` through
    ``futures._chain_future``'s ``_call_check_cancel``, which cancels a work item
    that has not begun. That is the dropped unlink this whole design exists to
    prevent -- the crumb survives to the next boot and a cleanly ended session is
    reported as ``crashed``. Unlinking inline in the cancellation handler removes
    the drop but puts a filesystem syscall back on the event loop, which this
    hop exists to avoid.

    So the hop is a BARE ``run_in_executor`` future, awaited through
    :func:`asyncio.shield`. Cancelling the shield leaves the inner future alone, so
    nothing cancels the queued work and it runs when a thread frees up. Two details
    make abandoning it safe, and both are why this is not the fire-and-forget shape
    the start path forbids:

    * It is a Future, NOT a Task. ``asyncio.runners._cancel_all_tasks`` at loop
      teardown iterates ``all_tasks()``, which holds Tasks only -- so shielding a
      ``to_thread`` COROUTINE would be wrong, because ``shield`` would wrap it in a
      Task that loop teardown cancels, dropping a still-queued item all over again.
      A bare future survives that sweep, and ``shutdown_default_executor(wait=True)``
      then drains the queue; even without it, ``ThreadPoolExecutor``'s ``atexit``
      hook runs queued items before its sentinel.
    * A worker finishing after the loop closed cannot raise "Event loop is closed"
      -- ``_chain_future._call_set_state`` returns early when ``dest_loop.is_closed()``
      rather than calling ``call_soon_threadsafe``. That failure (see
      ``test_the_crumb_write_is_never_a_loop_bound_future``) was a start-path write
      that was never awaited at all; here the normal path awaits to completion and
      only a cancellation abandons the future.

    The start path still must not do this: its write has to be ORDERED under the
    caller's registry lock, so it cannot be allowed to land late. An end's unlink
    can, because the crumb name encodes the writer and the generation -- a late
    unlink can only ever reach the file its own session wrote.

    This helper therefore never raises, so it cannot abort a caller mid-teardown
    either; each end path keeps its own guard for the reason
    :func:`record_session_ended` documents.

    Takes no lock. Each path names this process and one generation, and the
    backfill skips every crumb whose owner is live, so the files this removes and
    the files that scan reads are disjoint sets.
