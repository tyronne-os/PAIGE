"""Process-resource observable instruments — threads, FDs, GC, memory, CPU.

The gateway had no continuous view of its own resource state: thread counts
were only visible in stall dumps (``dashboard.loop_watchdog``), file
descriptors and GC not at all, and memory only as a point-in-time dashboard
read. Leaks therefore surfaced as outages instead of trends — a native
thread-pool leak, for example, is invisible to ``threading.active_count()``
(non-Python threads) and only shows in the OS thread count.

These instruments close that gap using OTEL *observable* (asynchronous)
instruments: each callback runs only when the ``PeriodicExportingMetricReader``
collects, on the reader's own ticker thread. No sampler thread of our own, no
work at rest, and nothing at all unless telemetry is enabled — registration
happens on ``provider._build_recorder()``'s live path only, so the
``telemetry.enabled`` consent gate covers these gauges too.

Instruments (all in the core ``kirocrew.`` namespace, validated against
``schema.validate_name`` at registration):

===============================================  ==========  ====================

The last four report a monotonic PROCESS-LIFETIME total and were observable
COUNTERS until they were the only cumulative series Kiro Crew exported. One
cumulative series is enough to force every consumer into stateful whole-hour
aggregation — a cumulative counter's hourly increment is last-minus-first across
the entire hour, per host and per process lifetime — while every other instrument
here is additive (delta sums, histograms) or associative (gauge min/max/avg) and
merges one datapoint at a time. Registering them as observable GAUGES keeps the
data (the value is still the lifetime total; the per-interval increment is
recovered by differencing consecutive samples) and removes the last cumulative
series. The route NOT taken is observable counters with DELTA temporality: that
was tried and reverted, because an observable callback reads an external
lifetime total, so the first collection after a provider rebuild re-emits the
whole total as one giant delta (see :mod:`kiro_crew.metrics.temporality`).

Gauge is also the safer encoding for these four specifically. A retried export
double-counts a delta, while min/max/avg are idempotent; and a gauge has no
baseline, so a provider rebuild on a telemetry-consent change cannot manufacture
a step. :data:`LIFETIME_TOTAL_METRICS` names them for the one consumer that must
know the difference — the dashboard aggregator reduces them window-relative
instead of reporting the newest lifetime total as a reading, which also keeps its
series continuous across shards written before the switch.

Current vs peak RSS are separate metrics because they answer different
questions: a leak-vs-plateau diagnosis needs the current value (which falls
when memory is released), while a transient spike that the live reading has
already forgotten shows only in the high-water mark. ``platform_compat``
provides exactly this pair cross-platform — ``proc_rss_bytes`` (current) and
``proc_peak_rss_bytes`` (peak) — so both gauges delegate to it.

A callback that raises would otherwise surface as SDK-level error logs every
export cycle, so every reader is wrapped: on failure it yields no observation
for that cycle (a gap in the series, never a crash and never a fake zero).

Cardinality: all names are constants and the only attribute is ``generation``
with three values — well inside the recorder's low-cardinality contract.

GC pause *durations* are deliberately out of scope: they would need a
``gc.callbacks`` hook timing every collection (overhead on each GC, telemetry
on or off), whereas everything here is free until the reader collects.

OSS-CLEAN: opentelemetry (Apache-2.0) + stdlib + first-party helpers only.
The opentelemetry import is deferred into :func:`register_process_gauges` so
this module stays importable when the SDK is absent (env-closure drift) —
mirroring ``recorder.py``'s convention.
