"""Install-inventory observable instruments -- what this install has configured.

``process_gauges`` answers "how is this process behaving"; nothing answers "what
does this install actually have set up". An operator running Kiro Crew across
more than one machine has no way to see that a host stopped scheduling crons, or
that skills and knowledge documents are piling up on one box and absent on
another: the dashboard shows one machine's counts on request, and nothing samples
them over time, so a config drift between hosts is only visible by opening each
dashboard in turn.

WHAT THESE CANNOT ANSWER, and it matters because the metric names invite the
mistake: they are NOT project-wide feature-adoption analytics. Collection is
off by default, egress is a second opt-in, and OTLP export additionally requires
the ``kirocrew[otlp]`` extra, so any aggregate over these gauges describes one
operator's own opted-in fleet and nothing else. That is not an accident to be
fixed later -- ``beacon.py`` is the project's install-analytics channel, and its
docstring lists four independently disqualifying reasons adoption data cannot
ride the metrics trunk (the redaction guardrail eats an install id, the extra
skews the population, ``telemetry.enabled`` is a published no-egress promise, and
pre-aggregated points cannot be deduped per install). Every instrument here
serves the same job the rest of ``kirocrew.*`` serves: an operator observing
machines they run.

HOST ATTRIBUTION IS BOUNDED BY THE RESOURCE, not by anything in this module, and
the bound is worth knowing before building a per-host dashboard on it. These
gauges carry no host attribute of their own -- deliberately, since a hostname is
free-form and routinely embeds an employee alias -- so separating two machines
depends entirely on the ``Resource`` ``provider.py`` builds. Today that resource
is ``service.name`` plus whatever the SDK's own detector contributes. On the
version this project pins, that includes a ``service.instance.id``, but the SDK
generates it FRESH PER PROCESS: two hosts are distinguishable at any instant,
while a single host's series restarts whenever its gateway does, so
"watch this machine's cron count over time" is not something a reader should
assume works yet. The dependency range also permits SDK versions that contribute
no instance id at all, in which case two hosts are genuinely indistinguishable.
Both are properties of the shared resource -- every ``kirocrew.process.*`` gauge
has them already -- and both are closed by giving the resource a persisted,
install-scoped identity rather than by anything here; these instruments inherit
that the moment the resource gains it.

These instruments close that gap the same way ``process_gauges`` does — OTEL
*observable* (asynchronous) instruments, whose callbacks run only when a
``PeriodicExportingMetricReader`` collects, on that reader's own ticker thread.
No sampler thread of our own, no work at rest, and nothing at all unless
telemetry is enabled: registration happens on ``provider._build_recorder()``'s
live path only, so the ``telemetry.enabled`` consent gate covers these gauges
too.

``schema.validate_name`` at registration):

``kirocrew.inventory.probe.failures``      count      ``probe``       this module
=========================================  =========  ==============  ==================

A probe that cannot answer returns ``None`` and its instrument yields **no
observation** for that cycle. That distinction is load-bearing: "the monitor
service is not running in this process" and "the service is running with zero
loops armed" are different facts, and a fake ``0`` would merge them.

But absence has a second reading, and it is the one that would undermine this
module: a series that is not there could equally mean the probe BROKE, or that the
host stopped exporting altogether -- and telling a drifted host from a dark host
is exactly the job these gauges exist to do. That is why a raising probe
increments :data:`GAUGE_PROBE_FAILURES` instead of only logging. A broken probe
then presents as DATA -- the failure series is present and climbing, which a host
that stopped exporting cannot produce -- and the first failure of each probe is
logged at WARNING, which a default install actually collects, rather than at debug
where it would be invisible on precisely the installs that need it.

So ``None`` alone is not the test for whether something is wrong. The line is
whether the SOURCE is absent or unreadable, and each reader draws it explicitly:
an absent source is a silent gap, because nothing is broken (no auto-nudge service
in this process, a knowledge database on an install that never ingested). A source
that is PRESENT and unreadable is a fault, so those readers count a failure before
returning ``None`` -- an unparseable ``crons.json`` is the case in point, and
``cron._read_job_records`` names it a fault in as many words.

That line is drawn wherever the source lets it be drawn, which is not everywhere.
:func:`read_mcp_server_classes` is the one probe that cannot: the discovery loaders
it calls swallow a malformed or unreadable config internally and merge ``{}``, so an
empty roster and a broken config arrive identical and its ``None`` covers both. Its
docstring says so. Reading a silent ``None`` as "nothing to report" is therefore
sound for every probe whose source can distinguish the two, and for the MCP probe it
is the best available answer rather than a guarantee -- which is worth knowing before
building an alert on that series' absence.

Every one of them reports a **raw count**, including the two that read a store
rather than a config field. Publishing those two as a constant 1 under a
magnitude-band attribute is the tempting alternative, on the theory that a precise
document or lesson count is quasi-identifying -- but that theory does not survive
this module's own scope. These metrics go only where the operator points the
exporter: their own collector, about their own machines, and an operator can
already identify their own hosts by far more than a document count. Meanwhile the
band costs exactly what the gauge is for. Growth from 51 to 200 sources is the
drift worth seeing and a band renders it as a flat line; a band attribute is up to
five series where an integer value is one; and fixing the boundaries at emit time
is a one-way door once dashboards read them. A backend can band a raw count at
query time, and cannot recover a count from a band. The product's own thresholds
are still worth knowing when reading these -- 200 is the lesson-store prune
ceiling -- so the operator guide names them instead of the wire format
hard-coding them.

**Cost is the whole design constraint here.** A callback runs on every export
interval (60s by default) and, with an OTLP destination configured, once per
reader — so two ticker threads can enter the same callback concurrently. Every
probe is therefore either O(1) in-memory or explicitly cached, and the two
genuinely expensive sources are the reason :func:`_ttl_cached` exists:

=========================  ===========================================  ==========
probe                      cost                                         cache
=========================  ===========================================  ==========
crons                      one small ``json.loads`` of ``crons.json``   none
monitor loops              in-memory dict snapshot                      none
skills                     recursive ``os.walk`` of the skills tree     300s TTL
memory / config toggles    fingerprint-cached config read (2 stats)     none
knowledge documents        ``sqlite3`` connect + one indexed COUNT(*)   300s TTL
lessons                    mtime-cached JSONL read                      store's own
MCP servers                a few small ``json.loads``                   none
=========================  ===========================================  ==========

Nothing here walks a whole data directory, opens a write connection, or creates a
file. The knowledge probe in particular opens SQLite **read-only** and only when
the database already exists: constructing a ``KnowledgeStore`` would run schema
init and graph load, and would *create* the database on an install that has never
ingested anything — a telemetry gauge must never bring a subsystem into being.

Where the underlying source can only say "empty" rather than distinguishing empty
from unavailable, the docstring on that reader says so.

Cardinality: every metric name is a constant, and the only attribute values are
closed enums -- two ``class`` buckets, the fixed :data:`CONFIG_TOGGLES` key set,
and the fixed :data:`ALL_PROBES` names. Counts ride in the VALUE, which costs no
series at all. An MCP server's NAME is never an attribute, by design: the roster
is user-chosen free-form text, so it is both a cardinality bomb and a disclosure
of what the user has installed. Only the two-way first-party/third-party split
leaves the machine.

First-party imports are deferred into the readers rather than taken at module
scope. ``metrics`` sits below ``cron``/``skills``/``autonudge``/``knowledge`` in
the dependency order, so importing them here would invert it and risk a cycle;
deferring also keeps the default-off path from paying for imports it never uses.
The opentelemetry import is deferred into :func:`register_inventory_gauges` for
the reason ``process_gauges`` gives — the module stays importable when the SDK is
absent.

#
# The problem this solves: ``_build_recorder`` runs in every process that touches
# telemetry, and an install runs several at once -- the gateway, the MCP gateway
# daemon, spawned agents and apps (which is why the local exporter shards per
# PID). Process-scoped instruments want exactly that. Install-scoped ones do NOT:
# every process would report the SAME "this install has 14 crons", each under its
# own resource, so an aggregate over installs counts one install once per running
# process -- a fleet sum reads N times the truth, and a fleet average is dragged
# toward whichever installs happen to run the most processes.
#
# Deduplicating downstream is not available: that needs an install-scoped resource
# identity, and the resource carries only a per-process id today (see the module
# docstring). So exactly one process must publish, and it is ELECTED EXPLICITLY by
# the gateway calling :func:`mark_install_reporter` rather than inferred here. An
# inference was the alternative -- ``autonudge.get_instance()`` is non-None only in
# the gateway, so it would work today -- but it silently stops being true if that
# service's startup moves or becomes conditional, and the failure mode is inventory
# quietly disappearing. A named call is a contract a reader can find.
#
# What the election does and does not cover: it elects ONE GATEWAY PROCESS, which is
# one install everywhere the product runs one gateway per data home. Two gateways
# sharing a data home on different ports would both claim and both publish, because
# the dashboard's singleton is per PORT, not per data home -- a pre-existing property
# of that configuration (every install-scoped fact duplicates, not just these), and
# not something a flag can detect: a second gateway double-counts whether or not it
# runs crons. Closing it needs either cross-process arbitration or, more cheaply, the
# persisted install-scoped resource id that lets a consumer dedupe. A POD is NOT this

    quiet once a fleet converges. The gateway flips the bit on the first boot that
    initialises vector memory, fresh installs included, so a healthy install reads
    1 and keeps reading 1; it stays 0 when the subsystem did not come up -- vector
    memory never initialised, migration aborted before the flip, or the flag write
    was skipped because ``config.json`` is unparseable (that write fails closed
    rather than clobber the file, and retries next boot). In a converged fleet a 0
    is therefore an install whose memory subsystem is broken, and no other
    inventory series would show it.

    Returns ``None`` only if the config read raises; the field itself is always a
    concrete bool.
