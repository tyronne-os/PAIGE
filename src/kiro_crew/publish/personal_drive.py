"""The personal cloud drive: a publish destination in the operator's own AWS account.

One private bucket plus ONE CloudFront distribution, shared by every artifact this
provider publishes. Each artifact is a single object under a served key prefix, so a
publish after the first is an upload plus an invalidation -- seconds, no control-plane
wait, and no new billable resource per artifact.

Why pooled and not one distribution per artifact
------------------------------------------------
A distribution per artifact costs a cold create (minutes of propagation, during which
the URL the user was just handed does not resolve), consumes an account distribution
quota slot per artifact, and presents a brand-new distribution whose origin is a
still-empty bucket -- a shape security scanners flag as a dangling origin and some
auto-remediate by DISABLING the distribution, which kills the link permanently.

Why the drive carries its OWN tag, not the deploy engine's site tag
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine's ``list_sites`` groups resources by ``kirocrew:site`` and SKIPS anything
without it, and ``find_site_by_tag`` resolves a site by that same tag. Tagging the
pooled drive as a site would therefore make it appear in the deploy surface as an
ordinary one-off site, where recall empties it and destroy deletes it -- one action on
an unfamiliar row would wipe every artifact every user of this drive ever published.
The drive tags ``kirocrew:publish-drive`` instead, so the deploy surface cannot see it
and cannot name it. The ambiguity and ownership hardenings that tag-based discovery
needs are implemented here (:meth:`_find_drive`) rather than inherited.

Tagging the DISTRIBUTION takes a second step, and skipping it is not cosmetic.
``engine.create_distribution`` hard-codes ``kirocrew:site=<id>`` on the resource it
creates, so the distribution comes into existence carrying the very tag the drive
avoids. Left that way it is both destroyable from the deploy surface AND invisible to
this module's own discovery -- and because :meth:`_ensure_drive` treats a missing
distribution as "no drive yet", every publish would build another one. So the
distribution is CREATED carrying the drive tag and not the site tag, by handing
``engine.create_distribution`` the final tag set rather than correcting it afterwards.

Account identity travels with the artifact
------------------------------------------
The seam persists a publication's provider as a REGISTRY KEY and re-resolves it later
to unpublish or push. A destination whose key means "whatever account is default right
now" is therefore unsafe: change the default and a later unpublish runs against a
different account, reporting success while the original object stays served. So the
resolved account is bound into the ``external_id`` at publish time -- the one per-
artifact value the seam round-trips -- and every later operation uses that binding
rather than re-resolving the default. The public URL is built from the id's random half
only, so an account label never appears in a link.

Sharing
-------
``visibility="public"`` puts the object under the served prefix; ``"private"`` keeps it
under an unserved one, so a private artifact has no reachable URL at all rather than a
URL that merely lacks a link. ``"shared"`` -- a per-principal grant list -- is not
implemented and is refused explicitly rather than silently downgraded to public.

#: This drive's registry key -- deliberately NOT ``DEFAULT_PROVIDER``.
#:
#: ``publish_sync`` resolves an unnamed destination through ``DEFAULT_PROVIDER``, so
#: registering under that key is what would make this drive the edition's DEFAULT
#: publisher. Registering under its own key instead ships the destination while
#: requiring the caller to ASK for it by name: it is listed in the picker and
#: selectable, and a publish that names nothing gets the same 503 as before this
#: module existed.
#:
#: The reason is not that the drive is unfinished but that one question it depends on
#: is: what proves a publication exists, or does not, and which paths may act
#: on that. Answering it needs agreement across the publish engine, the artifact store
#: and the folder store -- three lock domains that do not nest -- and that contract is
#: being built separately. Until it lands, every window that depends on it is reachable
#: only by someone who chose this destination explicitly, rather than by every user on
#: the default path. Flipping this key to ``DEFAULT_PROVIDER`` is the last step of that
#: work, not a step of this change.
#:
#: The value satisfies the ``^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$`` shape the one HTTP boundary that

# needs no new bucket-level permission. It does NOT put the bucket into the deploy

        reasoning rather than borrowing its tag:

        1. The filter is the drive's OWN tag, which nothing else in the product writes,
           passed as a SINGLE filter. Requiring a second tag in the same call would make
           the result depend on how repeated ``--tag-filters`` flags combine, which is

        2. The bucket name must match this module's own naming scheme, so a bucket that
           carries the tag by accident is still rejected.
        3. More than one match is AMBIGUOUS and raises, naming every candidate, instead
           of pairing an arbitrary bucket with an unrelated distribution.

        The two resource types are discovered through DIFFERENT APIs, because one API does
        not cover both. ``resourcegroupstaggingapi`` returns only resources "located in the

        Every artifact on this drive is served from ONE domain, so without this they share
        a browser origin: localStorage, IndexedDB and cookies are keyed by origin, which
        means one published document could read what another wrote. The documents are
        mutually untrusted -- they are authored content, and the drive's owner is not the
        only author of what ends up in them -- so sharing an origin is the one cost of
        pooling that cannot be argued away.

        ``Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts allow-popups`` makes the browser
        give each document an OPAQUE origin: scripts still run, links still open, and
        storage is simply not reachable, so there is nothing to share. This is the same
        posture the dashboard's own viewer already applies -- it renders artifact HTML in
        an iframe without ``allow-same-origin`` -- so no artifact loses a capability it
        had; published copies were the one surface where the sandbox was missing.

        The ``sandbox`` directive is deliberately delivered as a HEADER. It is ignored in a
        ``<meta>`` CSP by specification, so injecting it into the document is not an
        option, and a header on a CloudFront distribution comes only from a policy.

        Find-or-create, keyed on a fixed name: the policy is account-global, so a second
        drive or a retried create must reuse it rather than fail on the name collision.

        A name match is necessary but NOT sufficient to reuse. This product runs agents
        that hold the user's own AWS credentials, so a policy of this fixed name can be
        pre-created WITHOUT the sandbox CSP (or with a weaker one). Reusing it on the name
        alone would hand its id to ``create_distribution`` and silently drop the
        opaque-origin sandbox this method's docstring calls the one cost of pooling that
        cannot be argued away -- published documents would then share a real browser
        origin and one could read another's origin-keyed storage. Separately, and with no
        attacker involved: if a same-named policy's config were never compared, any future
        change to :data:`_SANDBOX_CSP` would never reach an account that already has the
        policy -- the name still matches, so a stale policy would be reused forever. So a
        name match reuses ONLY when the policy's CSP equals :data:`_SANDBOX_CSP` exactly
        with ``Override`` true; anything else FAILS CLOSED, never silently attaching the
        mismatched policy and never silently creating a duplicate under a taken name.
