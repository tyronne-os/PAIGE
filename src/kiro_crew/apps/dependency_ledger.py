"""Dependency ledger — reference-counted tracking for app dependencies.

Tracks which apps installed which external dependencies (capability-manager
MCP servers, skills, agents) so that uninstall can safely clean up dependencies
that are no longer referenced by any app.

All reads/writes use ``fcntl.flock()`` for concurrency safety, consistent
with KiroCrew's existing file locking patterns.  Read-modify-write cycles
hold a single exclusive lock across the entire operation to prevent lost
updates.
