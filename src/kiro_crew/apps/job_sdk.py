"""Job SDK — app-scoped durable runs for long, user-initiated foreground work.

``CronSDK`` schedules work for later; this owns work a human started and is
watching NOW. The gap it closes is that the product had no server-side
representation of "a task of mine is running": the fact lived only in the React
component that started it, so navigating away destroyed the fact while the work
kept going, and the UI then reported the task as stopped. See
``docs/request-for-change/rfc-app-sdk-durable-jobs-and-view-state.md``.

Five design points are load-bearing rather than incidental.

**P1 records that a run EXISTS, how it ended, and whether work was OBSERVED --
nothing it produced.** There is no ``params`` a caller passes in, and no
``result`` payload a runner reports out. A run's record holds its identity, its
lifecycle, whether the runner reached a checkpoint, and, if it failed, one error
string. The checkpoint is a progress OBSERVATION, not a progress PAYLOAD: it
records the boolean fact "this runner reached a point of work" (see
``JobHandle.checkpoint``), which is SDK-minted and needs no sanitizing, and it is
what lets a ``done`` record state something watched rather than inferred. The
free-form ``result`` and a rich per-checkpoint payload are structured data that
must be sanitized before it can be written or served, and P1 has NO consumer that
reads them, so they stay out until P2, designed against a real consumer as types
that are sanitized by construction rather than by a rule each writer has to
remember.

**A runner is REGISTERED, not passed per call.** ``register(kind, fn)`` binds a
kind to the callable that services it, once, at app init. ``start(kind, ...)``
then names the kind only. This is what lets a caller that cannot hold a Python
callable — the browser, and the startup reconciliation pass — address a run.

**Cancellation is cooperative and DECLARED.** A worker thread cannot be killed,
so ``cancel()`` can only ask. The SDK cannot inspect an arbitrary ``fn`` to find
out whether it ever checks, so cancellability is the app's assertion at
``register(..., cancellable=True)`` and defaults to False. A run recorded
``cancellable: false`` answers ``cancel()`` with ``False`` rather than
pretending, and the UI hides the control instead of offering a button that does
nothing. A runner cooperates in one of two ways: it may poll ``handle.cancelled``
directly, or it may call ``handle.checkpoint``, which RAISES at a pending cancel
so the runner unwinds AT that point. The second is the stronger form -- the
``cancelled`` record then names an observed stop rather than a set flag -- but
neither reaches work the runner spawned onto a thread the SDK does not own. For
that work there is exactly one instant where a stop is possible: if the runner
hands the work back -- the reported #7814 case returns an unwaited
``concurrent.futures.Future`` -- then ``_stop_returned_work`` asks it not to run,
and the record states which of the two things happened. If nothing comes back,
nothing can be asked; that residue is #7814's execution-ownership half, which needs
the spawn to register itself and is out of scope here.

**One writer per run file.** There is no lock helper beside ``atomic_write`` and
concurrent read-modify-write of one document is last-writer-wins, so each run is
its own file and writers never share a path: ``start`` writes the initial record
BEFORE handing off, the worker thread is the sole writer from then on, and
``cancel`` writes nothing at all (it sets an in-memory event; the worker records
the outcome at its next checkpoint). Reconciliation writes only records from a
process that is already gone. A requested cancel still has to be visible to a
reader before that checkpoint arrives, so it is DERIVED on read from the live
table -- ``cancelling_and_live_ids`` -- rather than written down. Reading it costs nothing
the rule protects; writing it would cost the rule.

**Claiming a run and LAUNCHING it are separate, and the interval between them is
named.** That interval contains a disk write, so it is not instantaneous, and the
run is already in the live table while its thread does not yet exist. Three
defects came from code that had no name for that state: cleanup joined a thread
that was never started, which raised and escaped the disable so the records were
never deleted; a start that had already claimed launched into an app being
disabled; and the record said ``running`` while no worker existed. So the record
starts at ``STARTING`` and the worker itself completes the transition to
``RUNNING``, the live entry carries ``started`` as the one authority on whether
there is a thread to join, and the launch is a GUARDED transition performed under
the same lock cleanup marks with -- not an unconditional call. Each of the three
questions is now answered by reading state rather than by assuming it.

That discipline settles writer-vs-WRITER, not reader-vs-writer: a reader still
races the one writer's temp-file-plus-rename. POSIX hides this because rename is
atomic for a reader, so the reads go through ``atomic_write``'s
``read_bytes_with_retry`` -- on Windows the same instant raises
``PermissionError`` at the reader, and a record read is not optional here
(``get`` answers the HTTP surface, and ``iter_runs`` feeds reconciliation).

Staleness is decided by ``_ORIGIN``, a token minted once per gateway process —
not by pid, which can be reused by the very process doing the reconciling.

That token is the GATEWAY process, which also bounds what this SDK describes, and
the bound is per RUNNER rather than per app. A registration only exists where the
callable lives: ``register`` binds a kind to a callable held here in the gateway,
so only runners registered from gateway-side code -- an app's hooks, its routes --
are ones this SDK can execute or reconcile. An app declaring ``backend.entryPoint``
is additionally spawned as its own OS process (``apps/backend.py``,
``start_app_backend``), and that does NOT remove its SDK: the context builder gates
``ctx.job`` on ``permissions.jobs`` alone, so such an app still receives a
``JobSDK`` and the gateway hooks still publish it behind the shared routes. What it
cannot do is register a runner from that separate process, so work executing there
is invisible here. The consequence is not merely that such work is unsupported: on
a restart that ``_reap_stale_app_backends`` leaves the backend alive through,
``reconcile`` marks any record it left behind ``INTERRUPTED``, a terminal state no
later pass revisits.

    This is the reachability half of #7814. The SDK cannot stop work a runner
    spawned onto a thread it does not own -- unless the runner hands the work back,
    which the reported case does: it submits to a pool and returns the unwaited
    ``concurrent.futures.Future``. At that instant this process holds the only
    reference to that work, so this is the one moment a stop is even possible.

    The stop itself was ALREADY happening before this function existed, as
    hygiene: :func:`_close_quietly` reaches for ``cancel`` on a future to stop it
    warning about an unretrieved exception, and discarded the answer. So the
    record said the work "may still be running ... and cannot stop" about work the
    next line had just guaranteed would never run. This function makes that stop
    deliberate, moves it BEFORE the verdict is worded, and reads what it returned.

    **One answer, and it is one-sided on purpose.** ``True`` means the work is
    stopped and will never run. Everything else is ``False``, which the caller
    words as the unchanged disclosure -- the work may still be running and this SDK
    cannot stop it. An earlier revision returned a third value to separate "already
    executing" from "no guarantee available"; the two collapse to the same wording
    and nothing read the difference, so by this module's own doctrine -- a
    distinction stays out until the consumer that reads it exists -- there are two
    answers, not three.

    **Why the answer is keyed on the TYPE and not on having a ``cancel`` method.**
    A truthy ``cancel()`` does not mean stopped in general. Measured identically on
    3.10, 3.11 and 3.12: an ``asyncio.Task`` whose coroutine suppresses
    ``CancelledError`` answers ``cancel()`` with ``True`` and then runs to
    completion and returns a value. Treating that as a stop would report success
    for work that is still going -- the exact defect this module exists to remove,
    and worse than reporting failure, because the owner then believes the work is
    over and proceeds.

    ``concurrent.futures.Future`` is different, and its difference is documented
    rather than inferred: ``cancel()`` returns ``False`` if the call is executing
    or finished, and otherwise the call "will be cancelled" -- the executor's
    ``_WorkItem.run`` asks ``set_running_or_notify_cancel()`` first and returns
    without invoking the function when it is cancelled. So ``True`` from THAT type
    means the work never ran. ``isinstance`` is the right test because the
    guarantee belongs to the class's contract, and ``asyncio.Future`` is not a
    subclass of it, so the two never blur.

    **The stop runs app code on this thread, so it is fenced from BaseException.**
    ``Future.cancel`` invokes the future's done callbacks inline, and
    ``_invoke_callbacks`` catches only ``Exception`` -- measured on 3.10, 3.11 and
    3.12, a callback raising ``SystemExit`` escapes ``cancel()`` while an ordinary
    ``ValueError`` is swallowed and ``cancel()`` still answers ``True``. An escape
    here is not a caller's problem to handle: it would pass ``_execute``'s
    ``except JobCancelled`` and ``except Exception`` untouched, leave ``run.status``
    at ``RUNNING``, and let the ``finally`` persist a ``running`` record while
    dropping the live entry and the dedupe key -- a run reported active that nothing
    owns, which no pass revisits until a restart makes its origin foreign. So the
    stop is attempted inside a fence: a run must never be corrupted by app code
    misbehaving inside this SDK's own hygiene.

    The fence answers ``False``, which UNDER-claims -- the state transition happens
    before the callbacks fire, so the work is in fact cancelled. Claiming it anyway
    would rest on a control flow that was just violently interrupted, and the
    hedged wording is true either way.

    The counterpart to :func:`_lazy_call_shape`, and the load-bearing half. That one
    inspects the callable's SHAPE at registration, which is a proxy: it can only
    refuse the spellings somebody thought of. This one reads the FACT, at the one
    moment it exists -- whatever the runner handed back, once.

    ONE PROTOCOL QUESTION WITH TWO CARRIERS, then allow. The question is "is this
    thing finished?", and two kinds of object answer it:

    * a SUSPENDABLE cannot answer it, so it is refused outright;
    * a FUTURE answers it by ``done()``, and then by how it settled.

    **Suspendables, ONE verdict, and this reverses an earlier decision in this same
    change set.** Earlier rounds read the frame state and allowed ``CLOSED`` on the
    reasoning that a closed frame ran to completion. That was wrong, and the reason is
    worth stating because it is the module's own thesis turned on itself: ``CLOSED``
    covers a suspendable drained to completion AND one closed before it ever began, so
    allowing it recorded a completion nobody observed -- exactly the class of claim
    this module exists to remove. The two cases were then MEASURED rather than assumed
    to differ: no public attribute, ``dir()`` entry, code object, ``gi_frame``,
    ``gi_running`` or ``gi_yieldfrom`` separates them.

    ``gc.get_referents`` does separate them on 3.12, reliably, and is refused anyway --
    see :data:`_SUSPENDABLE_KINDS` for the measurement and why depending on it would be
    a defect rather than a fix.

    So the rule replaced the inference: a returned suspendable is a CONTRACT VIOLATION
    whatever its state. The reason string says only what this SDK knows -- that it will
    not accept the object and cannot tell what it did. It deliberately does NOT say the
    body never ran, because for a drained generator it did; that wording would swap a
    false success for a false explanation. Nothing legitimate is refused: the SDK
    discards return values by design, so returning a suspendable cannot serve a runner
    even in principle.

    An async generator needs no separate case now. It used to have one because its
    state was not portably readable (``inspect.getasyncgenstate`` is 3.12+ while this
    module supports 3.10) -- and no state is read any more, so the special case that
    existed to avoid a version-dependent record dissolves into the general rule.

    **Futures, four verdicts, and deliberately NOT flattened.** Unlike a suspendable, a
    future does answer the question, so the distinctions it draws are kept. ``done()``
    False is pending, so unfinished. ``done()`` True splits, because ``done()`` answers
    "is it settled", not "did it succeed" -- and ``cancelled()`` MUST be asked before
    ``exception()``, since on a cancelled future ``exception()`` RAISES
    ``CancelledError`` rather than returning it. That is a ``BaseException``, so it
    would sail through ``_execute``'s ``except Exception`` and crash the function whose
    job is classifying failures.

    **An unsettled future is FAILED, and that verdict is true rather than
    convenient.** The runner's contract is to do its work before returning, so
    handing back something unfinished violates it -- ``failed`` is what this SDK
    observed about the RUN, not a guess about the work.

    **Whether it can STOP that work is now asked rather than assumed.** An
    unsettled ``concurrent.futures.Future`` stands for work in a pool this SDK does
    not own -- but the runner handed the future back, so the reference is in hand
    at this one instant, and :func:`_stop_returned_work` uses it. A ``True`` there
    is a documented guarantee that the work never began and never will, so the
    reason says the stop happened and a retry cannot overlap. Anything else keeps
    the earlier disclosure verbatim: the work may still be running, this SDK cannot
    stop it, and a retry can overlap it. Terminalizing still releases the dedupe
    key either way; what changed is that the owner reading the record -- the only
    party who can judge whether a retry is safe -- is told which of the two
    situations they are in instead of always being told the worse one.

    What remains missing is a stop for work whose handle never comes back at all: a
    runner that spawns a thread and returns ``None`` leaves nothing to act on, and
    no stopping logic can reach it. That half needs the spawn to register itself,
    which changes the runner contract, and is filed rather than pretended away.

    **Why this is complete, which after nine review rounds is a fair thing to ask.**
    Not because cases stopped being found, but because the two carriers are now
    answered on different grounds. Suspendables need no enumeration at all: every
    state, known or added by a future Python, reaches the same verdict, so there is no
    fourth state to discover and no state table to go stale. The future protocol offers
    pending, cancelled, exception and result, and this maps every one of those.

    **Default: allow.** Safe now in a way the old default was not. The old code asked
    ``isawaitable`` first, so a non-awaitable future reached the default and was
    called fine; the future carrier now catches it by ``done()``, so what still
    reaches the default is genuinely a plain return value.

    never awaited`` when collected, at a point far from the run that caused it.
    The record already says what happened, so the warning is noise pointing at
    the wrong place.

    Two shapes, because they do not share a method. Coroutines and generators
    expose a synchronous ``close``. A future does NOT -- neither ``asyncio.Future``
    nor ``concurrent.futures.Future`` has ``close``, so an earlier version of this
    docstring named futures among the closable and was wrong about the one object
    the sentence was about. A pending future is retired with ``cancel`` instead,
    which is what stops it warning that its exception was never retrieved. An
    async generator's ``aclose`` is itself a coroutine needing a loop, so it is
    left to the interpreter rather than driven from this thread.

    This ``cancel`` is HYGIENE, and it used to be the only one. Stopping the work a
    future stands for is now :func:`_stop_returned_work`'s job, which runs earlier
    and reads what the stop returned. The two are not duplicates: that one answers
    a question the record needs, this one silences a warning, and by the time this
    runs on a future the earlier call has usually already settled it -- a second
    ``cancel`` on a cancelled or running future returns ``False`` and invokes no
    callbacks, since those fire once, at the state transition. Anything that call
    declined to touch still arrives here and is retired exactly as before.

    ``except Exception`` here is narrower than the fence
    :func:`_stop_returned_work` uses, and deliberately so rather than by oversight.
    Both calls can run app code -- a done callback, a coroutine's ``finally`` -- and
    a ``BaseException`` from either escapes ``_execute``'s handlers. The
    consequences differ: this call site is reached only AFTER ``run.status`` and
    ``run.error`` are set, so the ``finally`` still persists a correct terminal
    record and the cost of an escape is one lost log line. The earlier call runs
    while the status is still ``RUNNING``, where the same escape persists a
    ``running`` record nothing owns. Widening this one would change pre-existing

        it adds no writer) -- and each had to remember the same three rules. Two
        review rounds found a different one missed each time, so the rules live here
        instead:

        * the discard check and the write happen under ONE lock acquisition, the
          same lock ``remove_all_async`` sets ``discarded`` with, so cleanup can
          no longer land between a caller's check and its write and have the
          record recreated;
        * a serialization or I/O failure returns ``False`` instead of raising, so
          a caller's bookkeeping (the live table, the dedupe claim) can never be
          skipped by an exception escaping mid-cleanup;
        * the record is JSON-safe by construction: every field except ``error``
          is minted by the SDK from a str, an int or a bool.

        ``only_if_not_terminal`` ENFORCES THE MODULE'S OWN INVARIANT that a record
        in :data:`TERMINAL_STATES` is never revisited. It is not a new rule and not
        a heuristic: :meth:`reconcile` decides from a snapshot and writes later, so
        a worker that finished in between had its true terminal record overwritten
        by a false one. That is why the re-read is HERE rather than next to the
        decision -- ``self._lock`` is not reentrant, so this is the only place the
        re-read and the write are one atomic step. A check near the decision would
        narrow the window; it would not close it.

        The re-read costs one file read per non-terminal record, on the boot pass
        only, inside a lock this method already holds across a file write.

        Returns True when the record is on disk. A refusal -- discarded, already
        terminal, or a failed write -- returns False, and every caller treats that
        the same way: do not count it, do not audit it as done.

        Call from the app's ``on_startup`` hook. ``cancellable=True`` is the
        app's assertion that ``fn`` observes cancellation at checkpoints -- by
        calling ``handle.checkpoint`` (which raises at a pending cancel, the
        stronger form that makes the ``cancelled`` record an observed stop) or by
        polling ``handle.cancelled`` directly. The SDK cannot verify it, so the
        consumer's migration checklist has to name those checkpoints.

        A CALLABLE WHOSE INVOCATION DOES NOT RUN ITS BODY IS REFUSED HERE, at
        registration, rather than failing at run time. ``_execute`` calls
        ``fn(handle)`` on a worker thread and discards the return value by design,
        and three shapes return a lazy object instead of doing the work: a
        coroutine function, an async generator function, and a plain generator
        function. For each, the object is dropped and no line of the runner's body
        ever runs. Such a run USED to be recorded ``done`` -- a run reporting
        success having executed nothing, and silent, since an un-awaited coroutine
        warning goes to the gateway log at most. That is now caught at execution by
        ``_undriven_result`` and recorded ``failed``, so refusing here is the early
        friendly error and not the thing that makes the record honest. The check
        goes through ``__call__`` as well as the object itself, so a callable
        instance with an ``async def __call__`` is caught too.

        Refusing is deliberately not the same as supporting: driving a coroutine
        correctly means deciding which loop owns it, how cancellation crosses
        the thread boundary, and what a blocking runner does to that loop, and
        those are design questions this refusal does not answer. It answers only
        the question a caller cannot currently ask -- "did my runner run" -- at

        ran: for a drained generator it did, and that run is still failed because
        the rule is stated rather than inferred. Earlier forms of this docstring

        ``live`` is live-table membership: whether THIS process holds the run
        -- claimed at ``start`` just before the record is persisted and the
        worker thread launched, dropped only after the terminal write lands.
        That ownership reading is deliberate: it is the same authority
        :meth:`cancel` and :meth:`reconcile` already consult (``reconcile``
        spares exactly the runs reported live here). A durable record can say
        ``running`` while nothing owns it -- a terminal write that failed
        twice, or a record minted by another gateway process -- and both are
        absent from ``live``, which is what distinguishes a stale record from
        work this process is executing. Derived from memory at read time;
        nothing new is persisted, so it stays correct under any later
        heartbeat or lease design layered on top.

        ``cancelling`` is the read side of :meth:`cancel`'s "writes nothing".
        A requested cancel has to outlive the tab that asked -- that is the
        whole point of the SDK -- but persisting it from ``cancel`` would make
        a second writer on that run's file, and one-writer-per-run is what
        keeps ``atomic_write``'s crash-safety from silently dropping the loser
        of a concurrent update. So the fact is DERIVED from the live table on
        read instead. The window it covers is the gap between the request and
        the worker's next checkpoint, and it closes on its own: the worker
        records ``cancelled`` and ``_execute`` drops the entry, after which
        the status carries the answer. Deliberately NOT durable across a
        restart: a restarted gateway has no live table, and ``reconcile`` has
        already resolved the run to ``interrupted`` -- there is no pending
        cancel left to report.

        Both sets come from a SINGLE lock acquisition so a response renders
        them from one instant. Taken as two separate snapshots, a worker
        finishing between the acquisitions could serve ``cancelling: true``
        and ``live: false`` together for a non-terminal record -- a cancel
        pending on a run nothing owns. Within one snapshot ``cancelling`` is a
        subset of ``live`` by construction, and one acquisition serves a whole
        response, so a list endpoint renders every row from ONE snapshot
        rather than N of them.

        Call OFF the event loop: ``_persist`` holds this same lock across a
        disk write, so taking it on the loop can park the gateway for the
        length of that write.

        A run must never be left ``running`` forever and must never silently

        resolved record carries TWO facts rather than a sentence: how far the run
        had got (``interrupted_from``) and why it cannot be resumed
        (``interrupt_cause``). They are independent because they describe
        different times -- past progress, present capability -- and a consumer
        acts on them separately: a run interrupted from ``running`` may have
        committed side effects, one interrupted from ``queued`` or ``starting``
        provably has not, and only the cause says whether offering a retry makes
        sense. ``error`` is composed from both by :func:`_interrupt_error`, which
        is why the pass no longer has to choose one of two strings from the runner
        table alone. This runs only after every app has registered, so a missing
        runner means the kind is gone rather than not yet loaded.

        This is the ONE path that consumes records it did not write -- a file
        left by an older build, or hand-edited during an incident -- so a single
        unusable record must cost only itself. ``JobStore._path`` raises
        ``ValueError`` on a run id it will not turn into a path, and letting that
        escape would abandon every remaining run of this app, leaving exactly the
        stuck-``running`` state the pass exists to clear.

        **This pass decides from a snapshot, so it must not trust it at write
        time.** ``iter_runs`` yields a record decoded from disk; by the time this
        loop writes, a worker may have completed and left ``_live``. The write
        therefore goes through ``_persist(only_if_not_terminal=True)``, which
        re-reads under the same lock it writes with. That enforces the invariant
        this module already states -- a record in :data:`TERMINAL_STATES` is never
        revisited -- rather than adding a new rule: without it this pass overwrote
        a true terminal record with a false one, which is a worse failure than any
        unverified claim, because the truth was on disk and this pass deleted it.
