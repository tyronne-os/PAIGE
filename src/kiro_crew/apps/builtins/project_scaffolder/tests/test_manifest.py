"""Platform + manifest-contract tests for the ``project-scaffolder`` builtin app.

Create Folders From Project is a MANIFEST-ONLY builtin: this directory's app.json
is the whole app. Its UI is a lazy-loaded page in the host bundle
(``website/src/apps/project-scaffolder/ProjectScaffolderPage.tsx``) and its two
endpoints (``POST /api/project-scaffold/scan`` and ``/create``) are host routes in
``kiro_crew.dashboard.chat_folder_scaffold``. So the tests here validate the
*static* contract — which platforms the manifest claims, and the no-backend shape
that makes the Windows claim true — plus the one host behaviour that decides
whether the claim holds on a Windows volume (see the second section).

Everything resolves relative to this file, so the suite is machine independent.
