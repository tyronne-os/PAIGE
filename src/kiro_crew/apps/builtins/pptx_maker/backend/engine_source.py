"""PPTX Maker — fetching the presentation engine as a digest-pinned tarball.

The engine is a separate public OSS project, so it is not vendored into this
repository — it is fetched into the app's data dir on first use. This module is
the fetch, and it replaced a ``git clone --branch <tag>`` for two reasons:

**No system prerequisite.** ``pip install kirocrew`` must leave nothing for the
user to install by hand. ``uv`` is now a declared Python dependency (resolved
through the installed package, see :mod:`.provision`), but ``git`` is NOT on PyPI
and is far less universal than it looks — a slim Docker image, a fresh Windows
box or a locked-down corporate host may have none. A plain HTTPS download of
``https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/archive/<commit>.tar.gz`` plus stdlib
``tarfile`` needs nothing but the interpreter.

**A strictly stronger pin.** The old flow cloned a git TAG and then verified
``git rev-parse HEAD`` against :data:`ENGINE_COMMIT`, because a tag is a MUTABLE
ref that upstream can force-move. That check was good, but it verified the
commit id the SERVER reported for the tree it had just handed us. Here the
verification is a sha256 over the received BYTES
(:data:`ENGINE_TARBALL_SHA256`) — computed before anything is extracted, so a
tampered, re-tagged or rebuilt archive is refused rather than built and run.
Provisioning executes this third-party code (``uv sync`` compiles wheels; the
app's agents then drive the engine), so that distinction is the whole security
story of this module.

Follows :mod:`kiro_crew.embeddings` and
:mod:`kiro_crew.apps.builtins.papyrus.backend.tectonic`, the two in-tree
precedents for the same shape: an https-only fetch of a large third-party
artifact, sha256-pinned, streamed and hashed as it arrives, verified BEFORE
install, extracted with every archive member validated.

Everything here is synchronous and BLOCKING (network + filesystem). Callers MUST
already be off the event loop — see ``routes.off_loop`` and the
``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` rule.
