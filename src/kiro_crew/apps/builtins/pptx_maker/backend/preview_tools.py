"""PPTX Maker — installing the app-managed preview tools.

Slide thumbnails need two binaries the engine shells out to by name, and a stock
machine has neither:

* ``pdftoppm`` (poppler) — rasterizes the PDF to per-page PNGs. **Provided here,
  on every OS, with no download**: ``pypdfium2`` is already a dependency of the
  engine's own venv, so this module only has to write a launcher named
  ``pdftoppm`` that runs :mod:`.pdftoppm_shim` inside that venv.
* ``soffice`` (LibreOffice) — converts the .pptx to PDF. **Not installable from
  here**, for the cost-and-coverage reasons recorded in
  ``docs/system-specs/modules/pptx-maker.md`` § Preview tools (the authority for
  this decision): it publishes only OS installers, none of them an
  unpack-and-run tree, and the Windows ``.msi``'s cab is LZX-compressed, which
  the Python stdlib cannot decompress at all. So it is reported with a per-OS
  instruction instead (:func:`soffice_hint`), and the user's own install is
  picked up automatically.

Why one bin dir: the engine resolves both tools with ``shutil.which()`` inside the
``sdpm`` MCP server that kiro-cli spawns, so whatever is installed must sit on THAT
process's ``PATH``. :func:`.paths.preview_tools_bin` is that single directory, and
:func:`.provision.mcp_tools_path` is what renders it into the agent config's
``mcpServers.sdpm.env.PATH`` — appended, so a real system tool still wins the
engine's own lookup.

Everything here is BLOCKING (filesystem) and must run through ``routes.off_loop``.
