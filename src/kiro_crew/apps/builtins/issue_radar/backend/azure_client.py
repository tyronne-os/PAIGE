"""Azure DevOps client for Issue Radar.

The THIRD function-for-function mirror of :mod:`github_client`, alongside
:mod:`gitlab_client`: same public names, same argument order, same return
shapes. The app's routes, caches and React components were written against
GitHub's field names, so this module normalizes Azure DevOps payloads INTO those
names rather than introducing a third vocabulary:

    Azure DevOps                     ->  normalized (GitHub-shaped)
    work item id                         number
    System.Title                         title
    System.State (template-defined)      state "open" / "closed"
    System.Tags "a; b"                   labels ["a", "b"]
    System.CommentCount                  comments
    System.CreatedBy.uniqueName          author
    pullRequestId                        number
    status active/completed/abandoned    state "open" / "closed"
    sourceRefName/targetRefName          head/base
    isDraft                              draft
    policy evaluation / build            check run

Three properties of Azure DevOps do not exist on either other provider and shape
everything below:

1. **Work items are PROJECT-scoped and carry no repository dimension.** There is
   no "issues in this repository" question to ask, so ``list_open_issues``
   ignores ``repo`` and lists the project's work items. Two repositories in one
   project legitimately return the same list.
2. **There is no filtered work-item list endpoint.** Listing is always two calls:
   a WIQL query that returns ids, then a batched hydrate of those ids.
3. **The state vocabulary belongs to the project's process template**, not to the
   platform. "Closed", "Done", "Completed" and "Resolved" are all real closing
   states in different templates, so nothing here hard-codes a state name: the
   closing states are read from the work item type's own state definitions and
   the open filter is built from that.

Auth and credential handling follow the same model as the other two clients: no
OAuth app, no PAT stored by Kiro Crew, no hosted backend. Every call shells out
to ``az devops invoke`` -- the Azure CLI's REST passthrough -- which owns its own
credential (an ``az login`` session, or ``AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT``). This module
only (a) parses a project URL safely and (b) runs ``az`` with a list argv (never
``shell=True``), so there is no shell-injection surface and no token in this
process.

``dev.azure.com`` is the ONLY reachable host. On-premises Azure DevOps Server is
out of scope because the ``azure-devops`` CLI extension does not support it at
all, so there is no credential path for it to use -- ``_resolve_host`` refuses
everything else, and refuses an empty host rather than defaulting, for the same
reason ``gitlab_client`` does: a call site that forgot the host must fail loudly
instead of silently targeting a host the caller never named.

#:
#: ``:`` and ``/`` are two of six characters the COMPOSITION contributes, and the
#: universe here is the composed argv ELEMENT rather than the value inside it — naming
#: that universe wrongly is what let an earlier form of this allowlist refuse every real
#: call. Derived from what :func:`azure_transport.invoke` emits, captured by DRIVING it:
#:
#: * ``:`` ``/`` from the constant ``https://dev.azure.com/`` prefix in ``_org_url``
#: * ``=`` from ``f"{key}={value}"`` for ``--route-parameters`` / ``--query-parameters``
#: * ``$`` from OData keys this provider writes, e.g. ``$top``
#: * ``%`` from ``quote(org, safe="")``, further constrained to the octet shape by
#:   :func:`_reject_percent_that_is_not_encoding`
#:
#: The ``--in-file`` path is deliberately NOT covered here: its spelling belongs to the
#: HOST rather than to this code, so it is registered in
#: :data:`azure_transport._GENERATED_BODY_PATHS` and checked for genuinely hostile
#: characters instead. A character allowlist cannot describe every host's temp path — a
#: Windows 8.3 short name contributes ``~`` (``C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`` on a CI runner),
#: and a ``TMPDIR`` under ``Program Files (x86)`` would contribute parentheses — and
#: chasing those spellings is the same open-ended chase this allowlist exists to end.
#:
#: None of those characters is reachable from caller data: every shape check refuses all
#: of them, so each can only enter from a literal this module wrote. A test asserts exactly
#: that, which is what keeps admitting them from widening what an attacker controls.
#:
#: An allowlist rather than a denylist of command-processor metacharacters, because a
#: denylist is structurally fail-OPEN: every cmd.exe-significant spelling not yet
#: measured passes, and ``!`` demonstrated that the measurement itself flips with a host
#: registry value. Derived empirically, not curated — ``;``, ``,``, tab, ``(`` and ``)``
#: are all cmd-significant and appear in no legitimate argv element, and the allowlist

    Azure exposes no per-user effective-permission read through the CLI's REST
    passthrough (the security namespace / ACL routes speak in permission bitmasks
    against a namespace GUID, which is a different and far heavier surface), so
    this is derived from PROJECT TEAM MEMBERSHIP: a member of any project team
    holds the Contributors rights, which are what ``triage`` and ``push`` gate on
    here.

    This field decides which controls the UI offers, and ``routes._repo_can_write``
    consults it before admitting a mutation, so it is a GATE and it reports NO write
    access on Azure DevOps.

    The reason is that the only signal reachable through the CLI passthrough is
    project TEAM MEMBERSHIP, and membership does not imply repository write.
    Azure's permissions are per-repository ACLs that a project can override: a team
    member can have Git "Contribute" denied while still being able to edit work
    items, or the reverse. Reporting ``push``/``triage`` from membership therefore
    over-grants -- it offers write controls to someone the repository will refuse,
    and it does so through a gate whose answer is cached. There is no
    effective-permission read available here to replace it with (Azure exposes only
    namespace ACL bitmasks, which this transport cannot address).

    So the honest answer is false, and the consequence is deliberate: Azure repos
    are read-only through this app's own controls. A user who holds the rights
    still acts in Azure DevOps directly, where the permission is evaluated against
    their real identity rather than inferred here.

    ``pull`` stays true: read access is already demonstrated by the project being
    reachable and connected at all.

#
# An update carries oldValue/newValue per field, so the typed events GitHub emits

# than shown as a raw field name, matching the other clients' "drop the noise"
# behaviour.

# Field -> the event kind its change becomes. Only fields the triage pane renders
# are listed; everything else in an update is noise here.

# maps the app's provider-neutral request onto Azure's own concept:
#
#   close/reopen        -> the PR's ``status`` (abandoned / active)
#   review verdict      -> a reviewer VOTE on a numeric scale
#   comment             -> a thread with no threadContext
#   merge               -> "complete" the PR, with a merge strategy
#   auto-merge          -> ``autoCompleteSetBy``, a real reversible armed state
#   cancel / re-run CI  -> a pipeline BUILD, not a workflow run
#
# Azure supports all three merge strategies and reversible auto-complete, but its
# reviewer vote is PR-scoped rather than revision-scoped. Verdicts are therefore
# refused below; only a comment can be bound safely to the displayed discussion.
