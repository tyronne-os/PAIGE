"""Provider identity and dispatch for Issue Radar.

A connected repo on GitHub is fully identified by ``(owner, repo)``. GitLab and
Azure DevOps add two dimensions:

``provider``
    ``"github"``, ``"gitlab"`` or ``"azure"``. Decides which client module runs.
``host``
    ``github.com``, ``dev.azure.com``, ``gitlab.com``, or an allowlisted
    self-managed GitLab ``host[:port]``. A self-managed instance is a genuinely
    different universe: the same ``group/project`` path exists on gitlab.com and
    on every private instance, so the host is part of the identity, not
    decoration.

Both default to GitHub everywhere -- on the wire, in ``config.json``, in cache
paths, and in every function signature, so the additive design holds: an install
that has been triaging GitHub issues for months keeps its connected repos, its
caches, and its investigation ledger untouched, and a frontend that never sends
``provider`` keeps working.

``owner`` carries the whole namespace above the repository, which may be nested.
On GitLab that is the group path (``group/subgroup``); on Azure DevOps it is
``organization/project``. It is not split further because both providers treat
the whole path as the project's address, and keeping one field means the storage
layout, the connected-repo gate and every route signature stay unchanged.

Azure DevOps differs from both in a way no amount of field-shuffling hides:
**work items are project-scoped and carry no repository dimension at all**. There
is no "issues in this repository" question to ask, so an Azure repo's issue list
is its PROJECT's work item list, and two repositories in one project legitimately
show the same items. The UI says so rather than implying a per-repo list. Pull
requests have no such problem -- they are repository-scoped like everywhere else.
