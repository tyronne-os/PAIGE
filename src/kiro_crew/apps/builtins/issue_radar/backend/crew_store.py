"""Crew records, work items and the append-only event ledger.

One repository's crews live under its repo data dir::

    repos/<owner>/<repo>/crews/settings.json      protocol constants, repo-wide
    repos/<owner>/<repo>/crews/<crew_id>.json     one crew
    repos/<owner>/<repo>/crews/<crew_id>/<n>.json one work item (crew × issue)
    repos/<owner>/<repo>/crews/events.jsonl       append-only progress log

Every file carries ``schema``. Issue Radar's usual versioning strategy — a schema
mismatch is a cache miss, refetch from the forge — does NOT transfer here: a crew
record has no upstream to refetch from, so readers coerce forward on read and a
real migration is required if the shape ever changes incompatibly.

Locking. ``store.py``'s per-record lock is the model, with one deliberate
difference: work-item writes take the **crew-level** lock, not a per-item one.
The "at most one item in an editing phase" invariant is a statement about the
whole crew, so the check and the write must be atomic together; a per-item lock
would let two concurrent writes each observe no other editor and both proceed.

LOCK ORDER, for the one path that holds more than one lock. A crew's progress
write spans three files, so :func:`commit_work_progress` holds locks across the
WHOLE transaction and takes the remaining ones from inside that hold:
**crew -> skip(number) -> records -> events**. Nothing anywhere takes two of
these in the other relative order, so the order is total.

The outer two are held across the whole transaction, INCLUDING its rollback,
because each of them guards a value the rollback has to still be entitled to
change:

  * the CREW lock, for the work item. The transaction restores a snapshot taken
    before the first write, and a rollback target another writer can move while
    the snapshot is held is not a rollback — it puts a stale snapshot over a value
    that committed.
  * the SKIP lock, for one issue number in the shared index. The index is
    REPO-WIDE and the crew lock is PER-CREW, so the crew lock serialises nothing
    at all between two crews passing on the same issue: the second crew's
    ``record_skip`` finds the first crew's entry, commits its own item and ledger
    line against it, and the first crew's rollback then deletes an entry the
    second one has already committed against. Per-NUMBER rather than repo-wide, so
    two crews passing on two DIFFERENT issues still run concurrently — the pair
    that has to be serialised is the pair contending for one index entry.

    Two decoded JSON values reach here that ``int()`` cannot convert, and both are

    * ``Infinity``/``-Infinity``/``NaN``, which Python's ``json`` accepts by
      default — and which ``1e309`` also produces, by overflowing SILENTLY on the
      way in, so a plain-looking literal is enough. ``int(inf)`` raises
      ``OverflowError`` and ``int(nan)`` raises ``ValueError``, which is a 500 from
      whichever route touched the value rather than the clean refusal the caller
      earned.
    * ``True``/``False``. ``bool`` is a subclass of ``int``, so ``json`` ``true``
      would otherwise store as ``1`` — the same trap ``routes._pr_number_field``
      guards, and for the same reason.

    Non-finite is refused rather than clamped, because there is no defensible
    finite value to clamp it to and a stored ``inf`` is worse than the crash it
    replaces: ``json.dumps`` writes it back as a bare ``Infinity``, which is not
    JSON, so the dashboard's ``JSON.parse`` rejects the whole payload — one poisoned
    crew record takes the Crews page down for every crew in the repo. A comparison
    against it is quieter still: ``open_count >= inf`` is simply ``False`` for every
    count, so a cap expressed that way is defeated without raising anything.

    Returning ``None`` for "not a number" is :func:`_validated_text_setting`'s
    convention — the caller decides whether that means the default, ``None`` on the
    record, or a refusal. A FRACTIONAL float reads as "not a number" too: ``int()``
    truncates, so ``47.9`` used to store as ``47`` — a value the operator never
    asked for, silently, with the form reporting success. Truncation is the same
    silent substitution the frontend's ``Number.isInteger`` guard refuses one layer

    atomic; this one makes one crew's OWNERSHIP of an index entry hold still for
    longer than the write that created it — from before the entry is inserted until
    after the transaction that inserted it has either committed or rolled back.

    Nothing shorter works, and the crew lock in particular does not. The index is

    two DIFFERENT crew locks, so they are not serialised against each other on the

    entry, reports no creation, and commits its own work item and ledger line
    against it — after which the first one's rollback removes the entry the second
    one has just committed against. The issue then reads as un-passed to the whole

    locks, both read a ``taken_names()`` that predates the other, and both write —
    leaving two crews with one name, which makes an old check-in comment look like
    a live claim. Creation always held this lock; update and retire did not, and
    that is the hole.

    Holding it for retire as well costs nothing (crew edits are human-paced and a
    repo has a handful of crews) and closes a second, quieter window: update and

    The shared SKIP INDEX takes this lock too, for the same reason and not merely
    by analogy: ``skipped.json`` is one file every crew in the repo writes, so two
    crews passing on two different issues under two different per-crew locks would
    each read an index that predates the other and each write it back whole,
    dropping one of the two decisions. Losing a skip is not cosmetic — the issue
    it dropped goes back to being re-investigated by every crew.

    This lock makes ONE read-modify-write of that file atomic, and that is all it
    does. It does NOT keep a crew's entry its own for the length of a transaction —
    it is released the moment :func:`record_skip` returns, and two crews passing on
    one issue then race over who may un-index the entry. That is
    ``_skip_lock_path``'s job, and it is a different lock because it is a different
    granularity: per-issue and held far longer.

    No path nests this OUTSIDE ``_crew_lock_path`` or ``_skip_lock_path``. The one
    path that holds more than one lock, :func:`commit_work_progress`, takes the crew
    lock and then the per-issue skip lock and takes THIS one from inside both — so

    could only ever carry :data:`CREW_LEVEL_EVENT_KIND` -- a value to be re-checked
    and rejected rather than a choice a caller makes. Writing the constant directly
    removes the argument and the guard that policed it; :func:`_event_entry` still
    enforces the number/kind pairing, so the shape is validated in one place either
    way.

    Returns the same ``{"item", "event", "skip"}`` shape as
    :func:`commit_work_progress`, with ``item`` and ``skip`` as ``None``, so the
    write route answers one shape and no caller has to branch on which kind of
    write it made. ``coalesced`` says whether a line was actually written.

    CONSECUTIVE SWEEPS COALESCE, and this is the whole reason the function reads
    before it writes. "I checked and took nothing" is a recurring LATEST-VALUE
    fact, not an event: an idle crew is nudged on a timer, so appending one line
    per cycle would add an unbounded run of them. Every ledger read is capped and
    discards the OLDEST line first (:data:`crew_routes._DEFAULT_EVENTS` is 200), so
    a crew idling for a couple of hundred cycles would push its entire real work
    history out of its own work log -- the feature would bury exactly what the log
    exists to show. Recording the TRANSITION rather than the state is the same
    discipline :func:`commit_work_progress` already applies to ``phase``, which is
    stamped only when an item is created or actually moves.

    So the FIRST sweep after real work is written, and a sweep whose crew already
    has one as its newest line is answered with that existing line. The crew still
    sees its checkpoint acknowledged; the log just does not grow a duplicate. The
    timestamp therefore marks when the idle stretch BEGAN, which is the more useful
    of the two readings -- "nothing to take since 09:12" beats "nothing to take as
    of one minute ago", and how long the stretch has run is the question a human
    opening a quiet crew is asking.

    WHAT THE SURVIVING TIMESTAMP DOES NOT MEAN. It records when this crew last
    REPORTED an empty queue, and nothing about the present: consecutive reports
    fold, and a crew that stops -- an operator pause, a crash, a lost nudge timer
    -- stops reporting without saying so, because nothing on the crew record
    evidences liveness. So the ledger cannot distinguish a crew still checking from
    one that quietly died mid-stretch, and the crew page therefore renders this line
    as the past instant it is rather than as a claim about now. An earlier revision
    qualified it as "checking since ...", which read as present-tense activity and
    so masked exactly the failure an operator opens that page to notice. Closing
    that properly needs a real last-seen datum, which is a separate change.

    Deliberately NOT a branch inside :func:`commit_work_progress`. That function
    exists to make three durable writes all-or-nothing, and every line of its lock
    ordering and rollback is about reconciling an item, a repo-wide skip entry and
    a ledger line. A crew-level line has nothing to reconcile and nothing to roll
    back, so threading a ``None`` number through that transaction would add
    branches to the most order-sensitive code in the store to describe a case that
    has no transaction in it.

    ``event_text`` BECOMES PUBLIC on the crew page under the same rule as any other
    line -- see :func:`append_event`. Unlike an item line it is not rendered into a
    claim comment, because a crew-level step has no issue to comment on.

    compare ``crew_id`` to see that its own reason was not the one kept.

    THE SECOND ELEMENT IS NOT DERIVABLE BY THE CALLER, which is why it is returned

    THE FLAG IS TRUE AT THE MOMENT OF THE WRITE AND NO LONGER. It says this call
    inserted the entry; it cannot say the entry is still this caller's to remove,
    because this function's lock is released before it returns. A caller that will
    later COMPENSATE the write — un-index the entry if a subsequent write of its own

#   * for the SKIP INDEX the observation is `record_skip`'s `created` flag, and a
#     writer in the gap makes it obsolete rather than stale: the entry is still
#     exactly the one this transaction inserted, but a second crew has since ADOPTED
#     it — found it standing, reported no creation of its own, and committed its item
#     and its ledger line against it. Un-indexing then erases a decision the fleet
#     is already relying on.
#
# No comparison closes either gap, which is why no compare-and-set appears below. A
# comparison can only prove the file still holds what THIS transaction wrote, and in
# both interleavings that is precisely what it does hold: in the first because this
# transaction wrote last, in the second because the adopter wrote nothing.
#
# Reordering was considered and rejected. Appending the ledger line first would
# trade a missing line for a FALSE one, and the ledger is append-only and
# content-addressed: there is no retraction, so a line asserting a phase change the
# store then refuses (the second-editing-item refusal is routine, not only an I/O
# fault) stays in the crew's memory for good, and the retry appends a second line
# contradicting the first. A missing line is recoverable; a lie in the log is not.
# Indexing the skip first is worse again — see `record_skip`.

    or leave all three as they were. Returns ``{"item", "event", "skip"}``.

    *skip_reason* is what makes this index a pass: ``None`` means "no skip", and any
    string (the caller derives it from the request) records one. The reason is a
    caller's to choose, but the COUPLING is not: an issue cannot be recorded as
    passed without the same call storing the item and the line that explain it.

    ORDER: item -> skip index -> ledger line. The item first because the store's own
    refusals (an unknown phase, a second editing item) then happen before anything
    else is written. The index after it because indexing first could mark an issue
    passed repo-wide that the store then refused to move — an issue permanently
    filtered out of every crew's queue with no decision behind it. The ledger last
    because a line is the one write with no retraction.

    LOCKS, in this order: the crew's, then — only when this call records a pass —
    the shared index's lock for THIS ISSUE NUMBER, then the repo-wide record lock
    for the index file, then the ledger's. The first two are held across
    everything, including the rollback; the last two are taken and released inside
    that hold, by :func:`record_skip` and :func:`append_event`.

    The per-number skip lock is the one that cannot be dropped, and the crew lock
    cannot stand in for it: the index is repo-wide and the crew lock is per-crew, so
    two crews passing on the same issue hold two different crew locks and are
    serialised on the shared entry by nothing at all. See ``_skip_lock_path``. It is
    acquired only on the skip path because a transaction that indexes nothing has
    nothing there to compensate, and skipping the acquisition can never invert an
    order.

    Nothing anywhere takes any two of these four in the other relative order, so
    the order is total and two crews cannot deadlock. A crew lock is only ever
    acquired FIRST, so nobody waits for one while holding a skip, records or events
    lock; the skip lock for one number is the only skip lock a frame ever holds;
    and records and events are each taken and released without acquiring anything
    else. The work-item write calls :func:`_upsert_work_item_locked` rather than
    :func:`upsert_work_item` because that one would take the crew lock again — a
    file lock on a second descriptor, which blocks on the lock this frame already
    holds instead of nesting.

#: versions on its own cadence.
FABRIC_SCHEMA = 1

#: The phases that form the drawn SPINE, in topological order. It is

#: left on it — the other terminals are alternate endings, not later stages, so
#: giving them a column would imply a skipped item got further than a claimed one

    *events* are this item's lines in TIME order (oldest first). Each contributes a
    ``phase`` only if it carries one — a pre-feature line, or a write that carried
    no phase, simply has no key and is skipped here, which degrades the drawing to
    L0/L1 for that item rather than failing the fold.

    *title_hints* maps issue/PR ``number`` to the issue's REAL title, seeded from
    the issues and pulls list caches (:func:`_fabric_title_hints`). The crew ledger
    stores NO title — a work item carries ``number`` and ``phase``, not what the
    issue is called — so the title has to come from the same list caches Issue
    Radar already keeps, at zero extra API cost. A number with no cached title
    (never fetched, or aged out) folds to ``""`` and the lane shows its id only,
    rather than mislabelling the lane with the crew's resumable ``next`` intent.

    Three things a naive fold gets wrong, each pinned by a test:

    * **The live phase is the record's, authoritative — never the max timeline
      index.** A review round-trip (``awaiting-ci -> addressing-review ->
      awaiting-ci``) ends LEFT of where it has been, so keying the head off the
      furthest column reached puts the item in a phase it already left. This
      function reads ``phase`` straight off the record and returns it as its own
      field; ``timeline`` is only the history.

    * **Off-spine phases are an ``exit``, not a timeline entry.** ``skipped`` /
      ``yielded`` / ``handed-back`` / ``preempted`` / ``awaiting-reply`` leave the
      spine's topology intact. ``exit`` is the LAST off-spine line seen — but it is
      cleared the moment a later on-spine line reopens the item, so it stands only
      when the item's live phase is itself off-spine. (The record's live phase is
      the tie-breaker: a torn ledger that ends off-spine while the record is on-spine
      still clears the exit.)

    * **Re-entering a phase after an exit is a reopen, and each restarts the dwell
      clock.** ``reopens`` counts an on-spine line landing on an already-visited
      phase while an exit was standing — the store clears ``outcome``/``finished_at``
      on exactly that transition, so it is a real second life, not churn.

#: Ceiling on the ledger read the fabric fold joins against. The fold reads the
#: WHOLE repo's ledger (every crew, every item) in one pass, unlike the per-crew
#: ``GET /crew`` read, so its bound is larger — but still bounded, because the
#: ledger is append-only and a repo that has run crews for months has thousands of
#: lines that would otherwise all land in RAM on a page open.

    The crew ledger records no title — a work item is ``number`` + ``phase`` — so
    the lane's real title comes from the SAME list caches Issue Radar already
    keeps, at ZERO extra API cost: this reads whatever is cached and never fetches.
    A number that was never cached (or whose cache aged out) simply has no hint,
    and its lane degrades to showing the id alone rather than being mislabelled.

    Both open AND closed states are read, because a crew work item outlives the
    issue's open state — an item can be ``resolved``/``skipped`` while its issue is
    closed, so the open cache alone would drop exactly the finished lanes. Issues
    are read first and pulls layered on top: a work item that has become a PR is
    keyed by the ISSUE number it was claimed under, and the PR title is the more
    specific label for that lane once one exists, so it wins on a collision.

    Never raises: each cache read already tolerates an absent/torn/stale-schema
    file by returning ``None`` (treated as empty here), so a repo with no caches
    yields ``{}`` and every lane falls back to its id.
