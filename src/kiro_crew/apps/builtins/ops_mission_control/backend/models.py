"""Ops Mission Control — data model.

Three types carry the whole app:

``Signal``
    A normalized work item. Every provider maps its native object (a CloudWatch
    alarm, a PagerDuty incident, a Datadog monitor, a webhook body) onto this one
    shape — which is what lets the board, the dispatch heartbeat, and the
    knowledge ledger stay provider-agnostic.

``Incident``
    A claimed ``Signal`` being worked, with its status, the chat slot backing the
    investigation, and the ledger entries it matched.

``LedgerEntry``
    One learned pattern: what broke, what fixed it, how much we trust that. The
    compounding-knowledge mechanism — the reason the second occurrence of a
    failure is cheaper than the first.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/ops-mission-control.md`` (data model).

    The subclass exists so the raises are greppable and their intent explicit instead of a

    **The reachable path today is a version ROLLBACK on one instance, not two instances sharing
    a file.** An earlier version of this docstring justified it by ledger sync, which was wrong:
    ``ledger_sync`` says "Only the ledger. NOT the dispatch index" and explains why -- the
    index is last-writer-wins on a shared key, so syncing it would let two instances each
    believe they own an incident. Caught in review (First Principles). What remains, and is
    ordinary, is a bad release rolled back on a single machine: the file on disk was written
    by the newer build, and the older build now reads it.

    The other way to reach it is a future SCHEMA MIGRATION that retires a key, since an old
    record then carries a field the new ``to_dict`` does not emit. That is indistinguishable
    from the rollback case at the point of detection, which is why neither this class nor the
    message it carries asserts which direction the skew runs.

    The mutation must still refuse -- writing would strip the newer build's data, which is the
    same loss every other refusal here prevents. What differs is the REMEDY: the file is fine
    and the reader is behind, so the operator needs to move this instance forward, not repair a
    document. Reporting it as corruption sends them to fix something that is not broken.

    Subclasses :class:`CorruptDocumentError` so every caller that already refuses corruption
    refuses this too with no change -- the distinction only has to be visible where an
    operator reads it, which is the route layer's error code. Raised on data that is merely
    NEWER; genuine content loss stays a plain ``CorruptDocumentError``.

#: with an ``expiry``, a Sentry archive with an ``ignoreDuration`` — so adapters were
#: forced to express a mute as ``resolve``, which asserts something false about the

#: Actions whose success is OBSERVABLE by re-reading the signal's firing state, and

#: condition, so a later poll is real evidence about whether they landed. ``ack`` and
#: ``comment`` do not: an acknowledged alert keeps firing by design (see
#: ``normalize_state``, where ``acknowledged`` maps onto ``firing`` on purpose), so
#: "still firing after an ack" is the EXPECTED reading and says nothing at all about
#: whether the ack was applied.
#:
#: So an ack is left explicitly unverified rather than verified against the wrong
#: evidence. That is a gap this app admits: Checkmk dispatches commands asynchronously
#: through Livestatus and documents that a 2xx "only indicates whether the request was
#: successfully transmitted, NOT whether it was in fact successfully executed", and no
#: adapter here reports acknowledgement state back. Claiming a verdict from firing state
#: would turn an unverifiable write into a confident one, which is worse than saying so.

#:
