"""Ledger → vector index adaptor: git carries text, the local DB carries vectors.

This is the "back to database" half of the git-native sync. `ledger.jsonl` is the
synced source of truth (small, diffable, merge-reconcilable); this module projects it
into Kiro Crew's `VectorMemoryStore` so a *similar* failure — not just a
fingerprint-identical one — can surface a lesson a teammate learned.

**Vectors are never committed.** The embedding model is sha256-pinned, so a vector is
derivable from its text: committing 1024 float32s per entry would add ~390 MB at 100k
entries, conflict unresolvably as binary, and rewrite on every push. Text is ~38 MB at
the same scale and merges. So git moves text; each instance embeds locally. That also
means an instance can rebuild its whole index from a fresh clone with no extra state.

**Import is incremental, which is what makes large ledgers viable.** Re-importing 100k
entries must not re-embed 100k rows. Two guards, in cost order:

1. A local import cursor (``imported.json``) records the entry ids already projected, so
   a repeat import is a set difference — no DB round trip for known entries.
2. ``has_episodic_text`` is the correctness backstop for anything the cursor missed (a
   deleted cursor, a restored backup, a teammate's entry that arrived by merge).

Embedding is **deferred**, not inline. ``write_episodic(defer_embedding=True)`` stores
the row keyword-searchable immediately and leaves the vector NULL; one
``backfill_missing_embeddings()`` sweep at the end embeds the batch and rebuilds FAISS
once. Inline embedding costs ~0.4s per 2000-char chunk on CPU, so a 10k import would
hold the caller for over an hour; deferral turns that into one batched pass. The tradeoff
is real and documented upstream: a deferred row is absent from *vector* search until the
sweep runs, so this module always runs it.

Deferral also skips the store's similarity dedup (it needs a vector), which is exactly
why the two guards above are this module's job rather than the store's.

    its precedents), because the rewrite publishes the empty base over state it
    never read. Here the write is a UNION — ``_write_cursor(cursor | newly)`` —
