"""Ops Mission Control — the dispatch engine.

This is the module that turns the parts into a working first responder. Without
it the registry polls into the void: signals are normalized but nothing claims
them, and ``Incident.ledger_matches`` stays empty forever — which would leave the
compounding-memory mechanism structurally present but functionally dead.

One cycle:

1. Poll every configured ``SignalSource`` concurrently.
2. Diff against the dispatch index and claim what is unowned (atomically — see
   ``store.claim``; a losing claimant skips rather than duplicating work).
3. **Match each claim's fingerprint against the knowledge ledger** and attach the
   hits, so the investigation opens already knowing what this failure was last
   time. This step is the whole point.
4. Release investigations that have gone idle, so a dead agent cannot hold a
   signal claimed and therefore unworked.

The cycle is deliberately *not* an agent turn. It is deterministic Python the cron
calls once, which keeps the expensive part (an actual investigation) to signals
that genuinely need one and keeps the heartbeat's cost flat. A heartbeat that stays
silent and cheap is what makes a polling loop tolerable to live with.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/ops-mission-control.md`` (dispatch cycle).

    ``registry.gather_evidence`` already redacts every evidence BODY centrally, but the brief
    also prints the signal's own metadata — title, resource, url — and those were rendered raw.
    A signed webhook is accepted from anything able to POST JSON, and a console link can carry
    a token in its query string, so provider metadata is exactly as untrusted as a log line
    fetched from a provider. The brief then goes into the agent's context, and from there into
    the transcript and any session artifact. Found in review; the evidence on the same code path
    was covered while the metadata beside it was not.

    Both passes, and ``redact_via_context`` rather than ``security.redact`` directly, for the
    reasons ``gather_evidence`` documents: the two redactors cover different token families, and
    the context shim makes a loaded companion's declared patterns apply while an enterprise host
    that fails to compose its companion fails CLOSED.

    Kept here rather than in the SOP prompt so the *facts* are assembled
    deterministically and only the reasoning is left to the model — a prompt that
    asks an agent to go fetch its own context spends a turn on work Python
    already did.

    **Evidence is brokered, not delegated.** The investigating agent's sandbox has no
    AWS credentials, so it cannot read alarm history or logs itself — and the answer
    is NOT to give it any. The gateway already holds the operator's profile and
    already redacts every gathered body at a single chokepoint
    (``registry.gather_evidence``); handing the agent scoped, redacted *text* gives it
    what it needs to diagnose while keeping credentials in one place, which is what
    least-privilege guidance asks for. An agent with its own AWS profile would be a
    second credential holder whose reads nothing redacts and whose scope nothing
    bounds.

    So the flow is: gateway gathers (credentialed, bounded, redacted) → brief carries
    the text → agent reasons. Before this the brief carried no evidence at all, so an
    AWS investigation had signal metadata and ledger hints and nothing else.
