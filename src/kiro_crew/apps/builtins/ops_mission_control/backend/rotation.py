"""Autonomy gate and rotation-driven tier arming.

Two safety decisions live here.

**The autonomy gate** (``resolve_mode`` / ``authorize_action``) decides whether the
agent may write to a user's production tooling. The default is ``observe`` —
nothing is written anywhere. ``act`` requires BOTH an app-level mode of ``act`` AND
a user-authored rule whose predicate matches this specific signal. There is no
wildcard: a rule must name a source and either a resource glob or a label match, so
"act on everything" is not expressible. Autonomy is earned per-pattern by the
operator after they have watched the agent's proposals be correct.

This is a deliberate divergence from a common shortcut: auto-resolving alert types
believed to be always benign. A team that built those alerts itself can reason about
which are safe to close unread; a stranger's first install has no such basis, and
auto-resolving a human's production page on day one is a much worse failure than
being slightly slow.

**Tier arming** (``tier_states``) maps the on-shift answer onto which SOP tiers
run. Note the fail-open: an unreachable rotation API arms the on-shift tier rather
than disarming it. Wrongly arming costs a few API polls; wrongly disarming means
nobody notices an outage.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/ops-mission-control.md`` (autonomy gate, tier arming).
