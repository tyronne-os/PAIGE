"""Ops Mission Control — knowledge ledger.

The compounding-memory mechanism. When an investigation figures out why something
broke and what fixed it, that becomes a ``LedgerEntry`` keyed by the signal's
fingerprint. The next time a signal with the same fingerprint fires, the
investigation starts from the answer instead of rediscovering it.

This is the part that makes the whole app worth having: institutional memory that
actually compounds, so a fix pattern that would have taken a new on-call engineer
hours to rediscover is already written down.

Three design choices carry the weight:

**Append-only JSONL.** Never rewritten in place except by the hygiene pass. A
crashed writer can truncate at most the last line, and history is auditable.

**Content-addressed ids.** ``entry_id = sha256(pattern + fix)``. Two engineers who
independently learn the same lesson produce the same id, so a git merge of two
ledgers is a dedupe rather than a conflict — which is what makes optional
team sync viable without a server.

**Confidence decay.** An entry that stops being useful loses confidence rather
than lingering forever at "high". A ledger that only ever accumulates becomes
noise, and noise is what kills the undocumented, word-of-mouth approach this replaces.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/ops-mission-control.md`` (knowledge ledger).

#: and grow one JSONL line without limit — in a file that is git-synced across a team
#: and read into a model prompt. Keeping the newest is right for matching: an identity
#: that has not appeared in the last 200 occurrences is not the one about to recur.

#: Uses an entry must have accumulated before the fast path unlocks, on top of

#:
#: 2, and **1 would be vacuous** — worth stating because 1 is the obvious value to reach
#: for when someone later decides this is too strict. ``attach_ledger_matches`` calls
#: ``record_use`` BEFORE ``is_fast_path``, so at the moment of judgement ``use_count``
#: already includes the incident being judged: every match whatsoever has
#: ``use_count >= 1``, including a hand-POSTed entry matching for the very first time,
#: which is the exact case the floor exists to exclude. 2 is therefore the smallest floor
#: that says anything at all — "some incident OTHER than this one has been handed this
#: entry before".
#:
#: It also lands on the same line ``handover.MIN_USES_TO_RECUR`` already draws ("used once
#: is an incident, used twice is a pattern"), and drawing it differently in the two places
#: would let the digest call something recurring that the engine calls unproven.
#:
#: **The cost, stated rather than glossed:** the fast path now unlocks on the THIRD
#: occurrence of a failure instead of the second (occurrence 1 authors the entry,
#: occurrence 2 is its first use, occurrence 3 clears the floor). That is one extra
#: investigation that reads its matches as hypotheses. It is affordable because a
#: non-fast-path match is not withheld — the brief still carries the full pattern and fix,
#: and the only difference is that the agent is told to confirm before proposing.
#:
#: What the missing floor cost, and why the exact-identity layer made it worse rather
#: than better: nothing stopped one hand-POSTed entry arriving as ``verified``/``high``
#: with ``use_count == 0`` and immediately unlocking "propose this fix directly" —
#: ``POST /ledger`` takes ``confidence`` and ``trust`` verbatim. Then ``record_use``
#: BINDS the provider key on the first match, so from the second occurrence onward that
#: same entry matches EXACTLY, presenting a strictly stronger-looking claim on the very
#: same single piece of evidence. The floor is what makes the fast path mean "this has
#: worked before" rather than "somebody typed high".
MIN_USES_FOR_FAST_PATH = 2

#: Misses tolerated before the fast path re-locks. Zero, deliberately.
#:
#: The asymmetry with ``MIN_USES_FOR_FAST_PATH`` is the point: unlocking needs
#: corroboration, re-locking needs one counterexample. A fix that visibly did not hold
#: once must stop being the thing an agent proposes without checking — that is a
#: downgrade to "hypothesis", not a deletion, and the entry keeps its full text so the
#: next responder still reads what somebody learned. Deleting a used entry is forbidden
#: (``ledger-hygiene.md``) precisely because a fix that works sometimes is still worth
#: more than nothing.
MAX_MISSES_FOR_FAST_PATH = 0

#: Misses per use at which the nightly hygiene pass demotes confidence one step.
#:
#: A ratio rather than an absolute count so a heavily-used entry is not condemned by one
#: bad night: at 0.5, an entry used 8× tolerates 3 misses and demotes on the 4th, while a
#: brand-new one demotes on its first. That is the right shape — the more evidence an
#: entry has that it works, the more it takes to overturn.
#:
#: Applied by HYGIENE, never on the hot path, and it reports what it did. Demotion is one
#: step along ``CONFIDENCE_DECAY`` and never touches ``trust``: "somebody saw this work"
#: stays true even after it failed elsewhere, and rewriting that would be the ledger
#: editorialising about a human's own observation.

      an operator is watching a report is a demotion they can see and argue with. A
      confidence rewrite buried inside a claim would move the ledger silently.

      inflate the number that ranks the entry is the original defect turned inside out.

    A consolidation pass has to "resolve contradictions" somehow, and

    split the pattern descriptions so each is distinguishable — a judgement call about what
    the two causes actually are, which needs the model. Deleting one would silently discard

    Two independent downward paths, reported separately because they mean opposite
    things and the operator's response differs:

    - ``decayed`` — nobody needed this for ``DECAY_AFTER_DAYS``. Says nothing about
      whether the fix works; the estate moved on.
    - ``demoted`` — the fix was cited and the failure came back (``miss_count``). This is
      evidence AGAINST the entry, which is the movement the ledger previously had no
      mechanism for at all.

    Collapsing them into one number would let "your ledger is going stale" and "your
    ledger is wrong" arrive as the same sentence.

    The whole read → dedupe/decay/demote/prune → ``_write_all`` runs under ``_LedgerLock``.
    ``_write_all`` overwrites the file, so a ``POST /ledger`` (``upsert``) or a ``record_use``
    landing between this pass's ``read_entries`` and its write would be silently erased — the
