    write a replacement snapshot must fail closed rather than treating corruption
    as proof that no bindings exist. Those failures also preserve the last resolver
    map, so a transient read error cannot detach a live worker in this process.

    The top-level object was already guarded, then entries that were not objects.
    Neither was enough: ``{"demo": {}}`` is a dict, so it survived, and handlers
    that index the required fields directly (``meta["spec_dir"]``) then raised
    KeyError and 500ed the request. An entry is only usable if it carries both
    identity fields as non-empty strings, so that is the bar here -- at the single
    read chokepoint, rather than every handler re-checking.

    A malformed entry is unusable either way, so drop it rather than serve a crash
    -- the spec's files stay on disk and rediscovery can re-add it.

    Delete reservations left by a process that is gone are dropped here too unless
    their durable teardown boundary is committed. Before that boundary, an orphaned

    retried. Clearing an ordinary stale reservation in the returned copy needs no
    write: this is the read half of ``_mutate_index``, so the next mutation persists
    the cleanup. A reservation this process still owns is left strictly alone.

    Duplicate recovery is deliberately NOT part of this read path. It renames or
    removes files and must run once at app startup under the index lock, rather
    than repeating those side effects on every list/detail poll until some later

    lock and the sentinel is armed WITHIN THE SAME critical section, and a

    wrote -- so it must not happen for a spec this request no longer refers to: a
