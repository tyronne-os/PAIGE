"""Account center — aggregate the deploy profile registry by AWS account.

The registry (``deploy/profiles.py``) is profile-shaped: a flat list of
``{name, region, account, verified_at, note}`` entries. The portal is
account-shaped: an account owns one or more profiles ("keys"), and the page
shows one row per account. This module is the fold between the two.

Everything here is read-only against AWS and free: the only call made is
``sts:GetCallerIdentity`` (via :func:`kiro_crew.aws_consent.probe_identity`,
shared with the consent surface so the two never disagree about what a
profile resolves to), plus ``aws configure get`` reads to classify HOW a
profile authenticates. Both go through the deploy engine's sandboxed CLI
chokepoint; neither reads a credential file.

Names-only invariant (inherited, load-bearing): this module stores profile
names, regions, probe outcomes and display metadata. It never reads, writes,
or caches credential material, and it never mutates the registry — the deploy
surface stays the single writer.

Probe results are cached in-process (:data:`_PROBE_TTL_SECS`) because the
page re-renders far more often than credentials change state; ``refresh=1``
bypasses the cache for the explicit "check again" click.
