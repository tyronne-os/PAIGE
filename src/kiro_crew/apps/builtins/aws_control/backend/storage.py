"""Drive storage engine — one private bucket per account, three prefixes.

The bucket is the substrate for three console sections, each a view over one
key prefix: ``artifacts/`` (Library), ``drive/`` (Drive), ``backup/``
(Backup). One engine, one discipline, three views.

Everything routes through :func:`kiro_crew.deploy.engine.run_aws` — the AWS
CLI subprocess chokepoint (``--profile``, fixed argv, OS sandbox). No boto3,
no credential material, gateway-side only. The deploy engine's discipline is
inherited deliberately:

* **Stateless-by-tag discovery.** The bucket carries an opaque generated name
  (``kirocrew-drive-<12hex>``) and is found by tags, requiring BOTH
  ``kirocrew:managed=true`` AND ``kirocrew:drive=default``, plus the naming
  scheme — and multiple matches fail loud rather than last-match-wins,
  because discovery is a trust decision (delete/overwrite operate on what it
  returns).
* **Hardened at creation** via the deploy engine's own ``_harden_bucket``
  (BPA on, AES256 SSE, BucketOwnerEnforced), THEN versioning is enabled — the
  drive's deliberate delta from deploy-web. deploy-web keeps versioning off
  because its teardown empties with ``s3 rm`` (current versions only); the
  drive has no teardown surface in this PR, and artifact versions ↔ object
  versions is the point of the Library. A future destroy needs the
  version-aware purge the spec calls out.

CALLER CONTRACT (load-bearing): these functions do NOT check consent. Every
HTTP handler must gate with ``aws_consent.refuse_and_log(SERVICE_S3, ...)``
before calling in, and every mutating handler must run the two-call confirm
gate. The functions are sync (subprocess-bound) — call via
``asyncio.to_thread``.

    Exists for the gateway-proxied text preview: the browser cannot fetch a
    presigned URL itself because the bucket carries no CORS configuration, so
    the gateway reads on its behalf. A ``--range`` bounds the transfer to the
    preview window — S3 answers with the whole object when it is smaller than
    the range, which is the desired behaviour, not an error.

    The full size comes from the same response (``ContentRange``'s total,
    falling back to ``ContentLength``), so the caller can tell a truncated
    preview from a complete one without a second round trip. Owner-pinned
    like every other transfer, for :func:`put_file`'s name-reuse reason.

    The CLI only writes to a path, and a path in a shared temp directory is
    attacker-influenceable: a same-UID process watching that directory can
    swap the file for a link between our create and the CLI's open, and the
    CLI — writing with the gateway's reach — then lands the object bytes on
    whatever the link names. So the file is staged in a fresh private
    directory under :data:`STAGING_DIR_LEAF`, which every agent sandbox masks
    and the shared file-tool gate refuses. That mask would hide the directory
    from the sandboxed CLI as well, so the per-call directory is named in
    ``extra_visible_dirs`` — lifting the mask for this one fixed-argv spawn,
    never for the agent.

    The mask is a Linux/macOS mechanism; Windows has no sandbox, so there the
    destination is pinned by IDENTITY instead of by hiding, and the pin covers
    the whole path, not just the file. The staging root and then the per-call
    directory are each opened and held (:func:`platform_compat.pin_directory`,
    which refuses a link or reparse point at the name) before anything inside
    them is named: a held directory can be neither renamed nor deleted, nor can
    any directory above it, so the path the CLI writes through cannot be
    re-pointed at a planted junction. Inside it the gateway creates the
    destination itself, exclusively (``O_EXCL`` refuses a name something else
    planted first — a hard link to a sensitive file included) and holds that
    handle open across the CLI call too. After the call the path is re-checked
    against the held file handle (device, inode, link count) and the bytes are
    read back through that handle rather than by reopening the path, so a link
    that appeared anyway is refused rather than followed. The directory is
    removed before returning — nothing of the object outlives the call.

#:
#:   * Linux caps a single argument at MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128 KiB).
#:   * Windows caps the WHOLE command line near 32 KiB (32767 chars) - and
#:     ``subprocess`` builds that line with ``list2cmdline``, which escapes every

#:     another tool writing one), and a JSON document is quote-dense by
#:     construction, so a batch can DOUBLE on the way to CreateProcess.
#:
#: So the budget is set for the worst case rather than the typical one:
#: 12 KiB * 2 (every byte escaped) + roughly 300 bytes of fixed argv is about
#: 25 KiB, comfortably inside 32767. ``_WINDOWS_CMDLINE_MAX`` and the test that

    caller validates ``path`` with :func:`validate_key` first, which rejects an
    empty or ``/``-only value, so this can never be asked to delete a whole
    section (``drive/``) or the whole bucket.

    S3 caps ``delete-objects`` at 1000 keys per request, so this walks the folder
    in rounds: list one ``list-objects-v2`` window under the prefix
    (owner-pinned), batch-delete the keys it returned, then list AGAIN from the
    prefix -- deliberately WITHOUT ``--starting-token``.

    Resuming with a token would be wrong here. ``--max-items`` is CLIENT-side
    pagination: when the CLI truncates inside a server page it emits a composite
    token carrying an intra-page offset (``boto_truncate_amount``), and S3 is
    free to return a short page, so the CLI may fetch another to reach the
    requested count and truncate mid-page. Resuming then re-lists and skips N
    items -- but those N were just deleted, so the skip lands on SURVIVING keys,
    which are never removed while the call reports completion. Re-listing has no
    offset to get wrong: what was deleted is gone, so the next window starts at
    the next survivor. It is also memory-bounded, unlike collecting every key
    before deleting any.

    The walk therefore depends on each round removing what it listed, which the
    per-key error check guarantees. If a listing ever repeats without shrinking,
    the round made no progress and this raises rather than spinning.

    Each delete is owner-pinned for the same name-reuse reason as every other
    write. On the versioned bucket each removal is a delete MARKER, so 'deleted'
    is recoverable at the S3 layer until a version purge exists -- matching
    :func:`delete_key`.
