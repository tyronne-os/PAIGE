"""Library — cloud copies of artifacts on the drive's ``artifacts/`` prefix.

An artifact's current version is uploaded as ``artifacts/<slug>/v<N>`` plus a
``meta.json`` sidecar, and a local sync ledger records what was pushed when.
Artifact versions map onto both the version-named keys AND the bucket's object
versioning, so history survives even a same-key overwrite. Pull stays a
download (share/presign or Drive download) — merging a cloud copy back into the
local store is future work.

The ledger (``<app data dir>/library.json``) is display state, not truth:
truth is the bucket listing; the ledger only makes "synced · 2h ago" cheap.
That is a claim the code has to keep, so two rules hold it up:

* :func:`_update_ledger` is the ONLY writer. Push, removal and reconcile all
  edit the file through it, because two independent writers of one JSON
  document is how a later whole-file write drops an earlier record.
* :func:`reconcile` lets the bucket CORRECT the ledger. Without it a stale
  record is believed indefinitely, and the surface ends up accommodating the
  divergence instead of resolving it. It prunes only what the bucket has had a
  chance to disprove: a record stamped at or after the listing it is judged
  against is left alone, because that listing predates the record.

CALLER CONTRACT: same as storage.py — handlers hold the consent gate; sync
functions, call via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

    This is the direction that was missing, and every symptom the removal
    action kept producing came from its absence. The ledger is LOCAL and the

    a record the bucket does not back is dropped rather than believed. A stale
    record is not cosmetic: it made the console refuse the very push that would
    have restored a cloud copy deleted somewhere else.

    Only that direction is safe to automate. A slug present in the bucket but
    absent from the ledger cannot be reconstructed here — version and push time
    live in its ``meta.json``, one GET per slug — so it is reported to the
    caller instead (see ``routes._handle_library_list``), never invented.

    ``remote_slugs`` MUST be a COMPLETE listing of this account's library
    prefix, which is what :func:`storage.list_library_folders` guarantees and
    what the paged display listing does not. This function concludes ABSENCE
    from it, and absence from a partial listing would delete live records.

    ``observed_at`` is when that listing was taken, and it is REQUIRED because
    the listing is a snapshot: a push completing after it — objects uploaded,
    record written — is absent from ``remote_slugs`` while the bucket does back
    it, and pruning on the stale snapshot would delete a live record. So a
    record written at or after the snapshot is never pruned; the bucket has not
    had a chance to disprove it yet (see :func:`_recorded_at_or_after`).
    Under-pruning is the safe direction, and it self-corrects: the next render's
    snapshot postdates the record.

    "Together" is an ORDER, not a transaction: a local file and a remote bucket
    cannot be committed as one, and pretending otherwise is what produced three
    rounds of the same defect. So the order is chosen for which divergence a
    crash between the two halves can leave:

    * objects first, record second — the worst case is "the ledger claims a
      copy the bucket does not have", which is exactly the state
      :func:`reconcile` repairs on the next listing;
    * the reverse would leave an untracked cloud copy — objects nothing points
      at, in a bucket the user pays for, invisible to the surface that would
      remove them.

    That is why the two halves of this fix are one change: the removal is only
    safe to order this way because the reconcile direction exists.

    The record is forgotten CONDITIONALLY. A second gateway sharing this ledger
    can push this slug after the delete sweep has finished looking, and its
    record names objects that really are in the bucket -- so a record written at
    or after the sweep survives and ``forgotten`` reports False. The same rule
    reconcile applies to its listing (:func:`_recorded_at_or_after`), asked of
    the sweep instead. ``routes._library_lock`` already prevents the in-process
    version of this race; this is the half that holds across processes.

    The whole ``<slug>/`` prefix goes, not just the version the ledger recorded.
    An artifact pushed at v1 and again at v2 has TWO content keys plus the
    sidecar, and deleting only the recorded version would leave a paid object
    behind that no surface lists. ``storage.delete_prefix`` anchors on the
    trailing slash (so a sibling slug sharing a name-prefix is not swept in),
    pages the batch API, and fails rather than reporting a partial delete as
    done.

    The bucket is versioned, so each delete writes a delete MARKER: the listing
    empties and a presigned share stops resolving, while prior versions remain

    removed from the drive, not billing-zero — the same meaning the Drive's own
