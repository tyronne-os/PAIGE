"""Backup — memory/workspace snapshots and session archives on ``backup/``.

Two backup kinds, one push path:

* **Snapshot** (the mockup's "Memory & workspace" row): the existing
  ``kiro_crew.snapshot`` engine builds its portable ``.tar.gz`` (memory,
  crons, config, skills, workspace, notifications, security — its component
  set, unchanged), and the archive is pushed to
  ``backup/snapshots/<name>.tar.gz``.
* **Sessions archive** (the "Sessions archive" row): one tarball of BOTH
  session halves — ``<data home>/sessions/`` (transcripts + rotated
  archives) and ``<kiro home>/sessions/cli/`` (the CLI replay logs) — pushed
  to ``backup/sessions/<stamp>.tar.gz``. Whole-set, not per-session: the
  "both halves move together" invariant is honoured by construction, and the
  per-session incremental integration with the storage inventory is future
  work.

**Restore is a download, deliberately.** A restore lands the archive in
``<app data dir>/restore/`` and hands back the path; nothing hot-swaps a
live ``memory.db`` or sessions dir under a running gateway. The snapshot
engine's own merge/replace tooling (or a stopped gateway) takes it from
there, and the UI copy says exactly that.

State (`<app data dir>/backup.json`): last run per kind + the nightly
toggle. The nightly loop lives in the app's ``on_startup`` hook.

CALLER CONTRACT: handlers hold the consent gate; sync, subprocess/tar-bound
— call via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (pushes of a large sessions set can run
minutes; handlers use generous timeouts).

    authorization decision off the audited path with it: the route's audit has
    already recorded ``successful`` by the time a worker thread reaches
    ``put_file``, and the Job SDK only records that the run ``failed``. To a
    reader scanning SEL events for denials, a real denial looked like nothing at
    all.

    The event shape is the one this app already uses for a refused mutation
    (``routes._audit`` -> ``sel().log_api_access``) rather than a second
    convention for the same kind of decision. It is emitted HERE, at the
    decision, and not in the Job SDK runner: ``_authorize_upload`` is also
    reached from the nightly loop in ``hooks.py``, and a runner-level catch would
    leave that path unaudited.

    ``caller`` is passed in rather than assumed, because covering the nightly path
    is exactly what makes a hardcoded interactive caller a lie: an unattended run
    refused at 03:00 must not be recorded against the dashboard owner. Each entry
    point states its own (``CALLER_OWNER`` / ``CALLER_SCHEDULED``), so attribution
    stays true on both instead of being flattened to a neutral string that is
    honest for one path and lossy for the other.

    ``outcome`` is ``denied`` for the access decisions and ``failed`` for
    teardown. Every refusal leaves a record -- one covered path among several
    would make the rest look like non-events -- but a routine restart is not an
    access decision, and filing it as ``denied`` would put it in the same bucket
    as a withdrawn consent and devalue every real denial in the log. Both values
    are from the vocabulary ``sel.py`` documents for this field.

    A PLAIN ``def``, and it must stay one. ``JobSDK._execute`` calls the runner
    and DISCARDS its return value, so an ``async def`` here would hand back a
    coroutine nobody awaits: the body would never execute, nothing would raise,
    and the record would settle on ``done`` reporting a backup that never
    happened. ``register()`` validates the kind and not the callable, so this
    property is the app's to keep.

    That constraint is what shapes the resolution below. The SDK gives a runner
    its handle and nothing else -- there is no ``params`` channel in P1 -- so the
    run's target is read back out of its own record, where ``start`` put it:

    * The ACCOUNT comes from ``dedupe_key``. It is the right carrier on its own
      merits, because the account is exactly this run's concurrency identity --
      two snapshot backups of one account must not both do the paid upload, and
      the SDK's index is ``(kind, dedupe_key)`` so snapshot and sessions for the
      same account still run independently. It is also the only field a runner
      can read without a private attribute (``get`` is public; the key is
      withheld from the HTTP view and never logged by the SDK).
    * profile/region/bucket are RE-RESOLVED here rather than carried, which is
      the rule this app already documents for the nightly loop: the drive is
      tag-discovered per run rather than trusted from memory.

    Every resolution step is therefore sync. ``accounts.resolve_account_profile``
    and ``aws_consent.authorize`` are coroutines and are NOT reachable from a
    worker thread -- ``asyncio.run`` would build a second event loop, which is
    the #4800 failure this package already carries a ``LoopBoundLock`` to avoid
    -- so this uses the sync cached resolver and lets the sync
    :func:`_authorize_upload` gate inside each runner make the paid-service
    decision. That gate is the real one: it re-checks the LIVE account against
    the target, that the app is still enabled, that S3 consent still holds for
    this profile+region, and that the recorded grant names THIS account, all
    immediately before ``put_file``. So a run started through the generic
    ``_jobs`` surface, which does not pass this app's HTTP pre-flight, is
    authorized by the same gate as one started through it.

    Refusals raise. ``_execute`` records the exception's text as the run's
    ``error`` and the status as ``failed``, which is the honest terminal state
    for a request that named no reachable target. The messages deliberately do
    NOT quote the dedupe key: it is caller-supplied, and the SDK withholds it
    from both the log and the HTTP view for that reason.
