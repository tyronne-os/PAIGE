"""Lifecycle hooks — the nightly backup loop.

One background task, started on enable, that wakes every half hour and runs
the snapshot backup when it is due (nightly toggle on AND >23 h since the
last run — see ``backup.due_for_nightly``). Every AWS-reaching step keeps
the same guards the HTTP path has: consent fails closed (a silent skip plus
a log line, never an unconfirmed charge), and the drive is tag-discovered
per run rather than trusted from memory.

The loop runs against the REGISTRY DEFAULT account only — the same account
the consent card confirms, resolved through the same healthy-first policy, so
the grant it checks names the key it runs under. Multi-account nightly
schedules arrive with the per-account grant store (spec §9).

    Registration is the SDK's contract: a kind is bound to its callable ONCE, at

    browser and the reconciliation pass address a run without holding a Python
    callable. It happens before the nightly-task guard below because a re-enable
    builds a FRESH ``AppContext`` -- and therefore a fresh ``JobSDK`` with an
    empty runner table -- so skipping it on the "already running" path would
    leave an app whose kinds have no runners.

    ``cancellable`` is left at its default of False. Neither backup runner polls
    ``handle.cancelled``: the only stop signal they honour is the teardown event
    ``_STOP``, checked in ``_authorize_upload``, which is not a cancel checkpoint.
    The SDK cannot verify the assertion, so claiming True here would put a Cancel
    button in front of the owner that does nothing. The UI hides it instead.

    The reconcile call is deliberate and is NOT redundant with the gateway's.
    ``reconcile_all()`` runs once after the WHOLE enable loop, so on the startup
    path there is a window -- every app enabled after this one -- in which
    ``_jobs/active`` would serve a run left behind by a process that is gone. The
    backup UI adopts an in-flight record on mount, so that window is precisely
    when it would show a phantom "running" for work nothing can finish. Calling
    it here shortens the window to this app's own startup, and it is safe to run
    twice: a terminal record is skipped (``job_sdk.py:786``), so the later pass
