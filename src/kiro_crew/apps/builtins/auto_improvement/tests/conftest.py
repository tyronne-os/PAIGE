## Why a git identity is forced here

Several tests drive PRODUCTION commit paths (``backend/commit.py``, the driver's provisional
commit, the watcher's export) against a throwaway repo. Those call ``git commit`` without
setting ``user.name``/``user.email`` — correctly, because in production the operator's own git
config supplies them.

On a developer workstation that always works even with no config file, because git falls back
to an identity derived from the SYSTEM ACCOUNT (the gecos full name plus ``user@hostname``).
A CI runner has no gecos name, so the same code fails there with::

    Author identity unknown
    *** Please tell me who you are.

That asymmetry is why these files were originally excluded from CI collection, and why an
attempt to verify them locally by emptying ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL``/``GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`` was
unsound: it removed the config files but not the account fallback, so the suite passed locally
and still failed in CI. Measured: ``git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT`` with both config paths sent to
``/dev/null`` still returned a full identity from the account.

Setting the identity through the ENVIRONMENT fixes it for every subprocess without touching
any repository's config, and mirrors what several tests in this directory already do inline
(``test_suite_scope.py``, ``test_dogfood_learnings.py``). ``autouse`` + ``session`` scope so a
test that shells out to git cannot forget it. Deliberately NOT a real address, so a commit
that escaped a temporary directory would be obvious in a log.

## Why the data home is redirected here

``store.data_dir()`` resolves to the OPERATOR's live app directory, so a test that writes
``store.config_path()`` without redirecting it replaces the repository the app is configured
against. ``write_json_atomic`` REPLACES the document rather than merging, so the live
``target_url``/``target_display`` are dropped and ``clone`` is left naming a pytest temporary
directory that is reaped when the session ends. The app's page then renders with no repository,
and calibration refuses because the configured clone no longer exists.

Nothing in the suite fails when that happens — the damage lands outside the assertions — so the
redirect is ``autouse``: a per-file opt-in fixture only protects the files that remember to ask
for it. Several files here already define their own ``data_home`` fixture; those still work,
because a function-scoped ``monkeypatch.setattr`` on the same attribute simply wins over this
one.

def _isolated_app_data_home(tmp_path: Path, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> Path:
    """Point the app's data root and clone scratch at this test's temp directory.

    Only ``data_dir`` is redirected, not ``workspace_dir``: every other path in
    :mod:`..backend.store` derives from it, so one seam covers config, the per-repo
    subtree, sessions and logs. Files that additionally want ``workspace_dir ==
    data_dir`` (so flat fixture paths and the per-repo layout coincide) keep pinning
    it themselves.

    ``AUTO_IMPROVEMENT_SCRATCH`` moves clones out of ``~/.autoimprove-scratch`` for the
    same reason: a test that clones into the real scratch root leaves a tree the app
    then refuses to reuse, because setup compares the requested URL against the
    push-neutralized origin the app itself wrote.

    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is the outer fence, and it is the one that matters most. Patching
    ``data_dir`` only redirects callers that go through :mod:`..backend.store`, while
    ``do_not_pollute_paths`` reaches the operator's home directly through
    ``config.loader.config_dir()`` — and that resolver is not a read: on the default
    path it migrates a legacy home, writes a recovery breadcrumb outside ``~/.kiro/``,
    and sweeps archive leftovers. Pointing the variable at a temp directory redirects
    every reader of the home, including the ones no fixture knows about.

    This is STRICTER than the rootdir conftest's own per-test pin, and the difference is what
    it is here for: the home lands under THIS test's ``tmp_path``, beside the app's own data
    dir, so the two coincide and a fixture path is coherent across both.
    ``test_data_home_isolation.py::test_the_config_home_resolver_is_the_tests_temp_dir``
    fails without it — the rootdir home is under its own isolation root, a tmp dir but not
    this one.

def _public_dns(monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> None:
    """Resolve every hostname to a fixed public address, and pin ``gh`` to https.

    ``resolve_origin_url`` re-runs ``validate_target_url``, whose ``_host_is_blocked``
    SSRF check does a LIVE ``socket.getaddrinfo`` resolve and fails CLOSED on any
    resolver error. On a transient runner DNS hiccup ``github.com`` reads as blocked
    and a legitimate remote resolves to ``""`` — flaking the legitimate-remote
    assertions and letting the refusal assertions pass for the WRONG reason (the
    resolver-error path instead of the allowlist/identity path they exist to pin).
    Tests that request this fixture are about URL/identity validation, not address
    screening, so resolution is stubbed — the same shape as the ``public_dns``
    fixture in ``test/test_meetings_providers.py``. The address decision itself
    keeps its own live coverage elsewhere; the production fail-closed behaviour is
    deliberately untouched (it is correct for a real DNS failure — the defect was a
    unit test exercising the real resolver).

    ``_gh_prefers_ssh`` is pinned on the same seam: ``validate_target_url`` shells
    out to ``gh config get git_protocol`` / ``git config`` (timeout=15 each) to pick
    a clone transport, which is a host-configuration dependency a unit test must not
    read. Pinned to https so the rebuilt clone url has one deterministic shape.

    Deliberately NAMED, never autouse: the patch swaps the shared ``socket``
    module's ``getaddrinfo`` for the whole process while a test runs
    (``clone_setup.socket`` IS that module; monkeypatch restores it at teardown).
    Tests that do other network I/O must not inherit it silently.
