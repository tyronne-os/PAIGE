#
# A curated list rather than every code a model might manage: each entry is a

# ── editable minutes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: App-owned root holding user edits of agent outputs, outside every meeting's

#: ``apps/meetings/data/edits`` is protected by the shared sensitive-path gate, so
#: an agent can neither read an owner's unredacted correction nor overwrite it with
#: ``fs_write``. The app backend opens the sidecars directly and remains able to
#: save, overlay, revert, and delete them.
AGENT_EDITS_DIR = "edits"

#: Ceiling on one edited agent output.
#:
#: This is a whole GENERATED document the user is correcting rather than a short
#: field: the note-taker rewrites its entire file after every transcription batch,
#: so a long meeting's minutes are already larger than anything a person types into
#: the app's ordinary forms.

#:
#: **The relationship to :data:`MAX_MINUTES_CHARS` is load-bearing, so it is spelled
#: out.** ``json_body``'s default cap is 256 KiB, which is FEWER wire bytes than
#: ``MAX_MINUTES_CHARS`` characters as soon as the text is not ASCII. A valid JSON
#: client may also escape an astral character as two UTF-16 surrogate escapes —
#: twelve wire bytes for one Python character. The body cap has to cover that valid
#: worst case, not only the browser's compact UTF-8 encoding, or the route accepts a
#: character count that some callers cannot save.
#:
#: 3 MiB covers ``200_000 * 12`` plus the small JSON envelope, and remains far
#: below the gateway's own 60 MiB ``client_max_size``. Raised for this ONE route
#: rather than for all of them: every other body here is a short field.

# ── importing an existing recording ─────────────────────────────────────────

#: Extensions the import route accepts. An allowlist, so an unrecognised suffix is
#: refused rather than handed to the transcriber.
#:
#: Extension-only, and it is worth being clear that this is NOT a content check: it
#: is a cheap "did the user mean to pick this file" filter. The suffix it validates
#: is LOAD-BEARING downstream, though — ``transcribe._forced_demuxer_args`` maps each
#: entry here to a forced FFmpeg demuxer (``-f``), so an imported file is always
#: decoded as the format its validated name promises, never by content sniffing.
#: The barrier that matters for an import is
#: :func:`kiro_crew.hooks.validate_file_path` (which enforces ``is_sensitive_path``),
#: and ``transcribe_audio`` re-checks the path itself — sniffing container magic here
#: would add a third opinion about audio formats without adding a guarantee.

    {".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".ogg", ".flac", ".webm", ".opus", ".aac", ".wma"}

#: user chose, and PATH_MAX is 4096 on Linux.
MAX_AUDIO_PATH_CHARS = 4096

#: Size ceiling for an imported recording, enforced BEFORE the decoder runs.
#:
#: The decoder materializes decoded PCM for the whole file, so an unbounded
#: multichannel WAV can cost several gigabytes of gateway memory before the
#: transcript-length ceiling — which only runs AFTER decoding — can refuse
#: anything. 512 MiB comfortably covers the product's own 4-hour meeting ceiling
#: in every ordinary recording format (a 4-hour 16 kHz mono WAV is ~440 MiB;
#: compressed formats are far smaller) while refusing the studio-grade
#: multichannel files that are the memory hazard — re-encode those first.
MAX_IMPORT_AUDIO_BYTES = 512 * 1024 * 1024

#: Lines one import may feed into a meeting.
#:
#: An hour of speech is roughly 500–900 sentences, so this covers a long recording
#: with room to spare while keeping a pathological file (a transcript of silence
#: split into thousands of fragments) from filling every agent queue.
