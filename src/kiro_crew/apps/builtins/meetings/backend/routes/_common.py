"""Shared request plumbing for the Meetings routes.

Holds the pieces every handler needs and nothing route-specific:

* :func:`require_enabled` — the deny-by-default authorization decorator. The app
  is ``defaultEnabled: false`` and routes are registered once at gateway
  startup, so without this a disabled app would stay callable.
* :func:`json_body` / the ``field_*`` helpers — input validation. Every value
  that reaches the filesystem or a model prompt goes through one of these.
* :data:`ACTIVE` — the single active meeting (``MAX_CONCURRENT_MEETINGS == 1``).

# * The live-session check, the transcript append, and the synchronous queue
#   fan-out are ONE transaction under ``DISPATCH_LOCK``, so a concurrent stop
#   followed by deletion cannot remove the meeting while a producer is awaiting
#   disk IO and then have the append recreate an orphan directory.
# * The expiry branch has SIDE EFFECTS — close admission, drain the queues, mark
#   the meeting ended on disk — and a second copy of those is a second thing that
#   has to stay correct.
#
# Extracted here rather than copied into each producer for exactly those reasons.

    request fails fast instead of waiting behind agent IO), then drains and marks
    the meeting ended under ``START_LOCK`` — which still serializes the actual
    teardown with start/stop/delete — and raises 410. ``guarded`` turns both into
    the standard error bodies.

    ``hold_during_init`` opts the producer into the initialization hold: when
    ingress is closed because the meeting is STARTING (not stopping/reviewing/
    expired), the starting session is yielded with ``holding=True`` instead of
    raising 409, and the caller buffers the line for the drain. Off by default so
    a producer added later refuses rather than silently buffering; it is also
    mutually exclusive with ``require_session`` — a hold admits into a session
    whose agents never saw the producer's earlier lines, which is exactly the
    identity confusion ``require_session`` exists to refuse.

    ``require_session`` pins admission to a SPECIFIC session object. A meeting id
    is a name, not an identity: a meeting stopped and recreated with the same id
    mid-operation installs a NEW session under the OLD name, and a producer that

    imported recording landing in a meeting it was never part of). Compared with
    ``is`` — sessions are dataclasses and two for the same meeting id can compare
    equal; identity is the question being asked. The check runs BEFORE the expiry
    branch on purpose: the expiry branch has lifecycle side effects (it ends the
