"""Meetings — import an existing recording into a live meeting.

``POST …/{id}/import`` takes a host path to an audio file, transcribes it with the
gateway's own batch speech-to-text, and feeds the result into the meeting exactly as
if it had been spoken.

**Why "as if it had been spoken" rather than a separate record.** Every line goes
through :func:`_common.dispatch_line`, the same admission transaction live speech and
the broadcast bar use. So an imported line is persisted to ``transcript.jsonl``
before it is fanned out — the app-wide data-integrity boundary: an accepted agent
line cannot be absent from the transcript — and then gets the SAME pipeline a
microphone gets: domain-dictionary correction, the noise gate, per-agent batching,
and the muted-agent list. There is no second code path to keep in step, and the
imported recording is readable back from the transcript panel like anything spoken.

The consequence, and it is the honest way round: an import needs a LIVE meeting. That
is not a limitation to work around — the agents are what turn transcript into minutes,
and they only exist while a meeting is running. The session is checked FIRST, before
the expensive steps, and each line is re-admitted individually, so a meeting stopped
while an hour of audio was being transcribed fails the dispatch loop promptly instead
of writing into a torn-down meeting.

Security posture:

* Only the dashboard OWNER may import: the handler refuses any other caller via
  :func:`~kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.source_providers.is_owner_dashboard_request`
  before the body is read, with the shared denial shape — the same gate the
  aws-control routes and the app job routes apply, because the capability is the
  same class: reading an arbitrary host file by path on the caller's say-so.
* The client-supplied path goes through :func:`kiro_crew.hooks.validate_file_path`,
  the shared dashboard file gate, which canonicalizes (following symlinks) and
  enforces ``is_sensitive_path``. The predicate is never called directly here — using
  the gate is what keeps this route's answer identical to every other file read in the
  product. The transcriber never sees the client-supplied name: it consumes the
  request-private snapshot produced by :func:`_snapshot_recording`, staged beneath
  the agent-denied voice-runtime root (:func:`_new_snapshot_dir`) so a same-uid
  agent cannot rewrite the pinned bytes in place.
* Rejections are SEL-audited.
* **This module calls no redactor of its own**, deliberately: ``transcribe_audio``
  scrubs and hallucination-filters what it returns, and ``_common.dispatch_line``
  redacts at the transcript boundary exactly as it does for live speech — a third
  pass here would add no coverage. (That absence is also why this module is neither
  a registered redaction sink nor an allowlisted non-egress module in
  ``security_posture`` — there is no call site to classify.)
