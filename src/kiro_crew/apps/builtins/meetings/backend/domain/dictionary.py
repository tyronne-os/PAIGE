"""Domain dictionary — corrects speech-to-text misrecognitions.

Speech recognition mangles project nouns ("dynamo db" → "DynamoDB"). The user
maintains a small TOML dictionary of alias → correct-spelling pairs and every
transcription line passes through it before reaching an agent.

File format (``<data>/dictionary.toml``)::

    [[term]]
    correct = "DynamoDB"
    aliases = ["dynamo db", "dynamo d.b."]

Matching is case-insensitive and bounded to a standalone occurrence (see
:func:`_bounded_pattern`); the longest alias wins so a multi-word alias is not
shadowed by one of its own prefixes.

The parse is deliberately paranoid: this file is user-editable AND writable by
the agent's own file tools, so a malformed or hostile document must degrade to
"no corrections", never raise into a request handler.
