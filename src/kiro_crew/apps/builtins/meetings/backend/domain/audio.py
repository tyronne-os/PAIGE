"""Meetings — turning a whole-file transcript into dispatchable lines.

An imported recording comes back from ``transcribe_audio`` as ONE string, but every
consumer downstream of the dispatch transaction is built around a line: the
transcript stores one record per utterance, the domain dictionary corrects per line,
the noise gate judges per line, and the agent batcher coalesces lines over a window.
Handing that pipeline a single hour-long blob would defeat all four — one giant
transcript row, one prompt too large to be useful, one noise verdict for the whole
meeting, and nothing to batch.

So this module holds the split, as a pure function with no IO, because the interesting
part is the boundary rules rather than the plumbing.

#: marks are followed by neither in practice, hence the separate alternative that
#: needs no trailing space.

    Raised INSTEAD of silently slicing the tail off: an import that drops the end
    of a recording while returning success is data loss the user cannot see, and
    there is no line a splitter could reasonably choose to discard. The route maps
    this to a 413 the same way an over-full transcript is refused, BEFORE anything

    """Break *text* into lines suitable for :meth:`MeetingSession.broadcast`.

    Three tiers, in order of how much the transcriber told us:

    1. **Its own line breaks**, when there are any. Tier 1 preserves whatever
       line structure the CALLER supplied: adapters that receive per-segment
       output may join segments with newlines before calling this, and a break
       chosen by the transcriber (or that adapter) is the closest thing
       available to "one thing somebody said" — better than anything
       punctuation can reconstruct.
    2. **Sentence boundaries**, when the whole transcript arrived as one line (AWS
       Transcribe returns a single paragraph).
    3. **A hard wrap at *max_chars***, applied to whatever tier 1 or 2 produced, so
       one runaway sentence cannot exceed what ``broadcast`` would truncate anyway.
       Truncating instead would DROP the tail of a long sentence; wrapping keeps it.

    Empty and whitespace-only pieces are dropped. A split that would exceed
    *max_lines* raises :class:`TranscriptTooLong` rather than discarding the tail —
    a capped result is indistinguishable from a complete one to the caller, and an
    import that silently omits the end of the recording is data loss (the check
    bails as soon as the budget is exceeded, so an hour of over-long audio is not
    split to completion just to be refused).
