"""Calendar-provider seam + a stdlib iCalendar (``.ics``) reader.

Upstream fetched the user's calendar through a company-internal MCP server,
with a second internal fallback that scraped an internal web endpoint.
Neither can ship publicly, and neither had a public equivalent.

This module replaces both with the same extension-point shape as
:mod:`..providers.tasks`: an ABC (:class:`CalendarProvider`), a name-keyed
factory registry (:func:`register_calendar_provider`), and a resolver
(:func:`get_calendar_provider`). **Two implementations ship**: a no-op
(``none``, the default — the app is fully usable with manually created meetings)
and :class:`IcsCalendarProvider`, which reads the iCalendar format every
calendar service can export or publish.

The parser is stdlib-only and deliberately small — it reads exactly the
``VEVENT`` fields this app displays. It is NOT a general iCalendar
implementation: recurrence expansion (``RRULE``) is not attempted, because a
correct expansion needs a full RFC 5545 engine and silently showing wrong
occurrence times is worse than showing only the series' first instance.

Fetch safety (AUTOSDE ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` + ``backend-security
-controls``):

* An ``https://`` source is fetched with **aiohttp**, never ``requests``/
  ``urllib`` — those block the gateway's single event loop.
* Only ``https://`` (and ``webcal://``, rewritten to https) is accepted;
  ``http://``, ``file://`` and every other scheme is refused, so a config value
  cannot turn the fetch into a local-file read or a plaintext exfiltration hop.
* A local source must be a real file path, is read off-loop, and is size-capped.
* Redirects are followed only within the https scheme, and the response is
  size-capped while streaming so a hostile endpoint cannot exhaust memory.
* The address the validator vetted is the address the socket connects to. DNS is
  resolved **once**, on the executor, and the answer is pinned onto the
  connection, so a name whose answer changes between the check and the connect
  (DNS rebinding) cannot steer the fetch at a private endpoint.

    Why a resolver rather than rewriting the URL to its IP: the connector derives

    A host that was not pinned is refused rather than resolved. Refusing is what

    One case never reaches here: aiohttp short-circuits a **literal-IP** URL and

    The size cap stays app-local: the shared gate's ceiling is a general
