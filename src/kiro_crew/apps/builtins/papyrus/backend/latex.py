"""Papyrus — LaTeX compilation and compiler-log parsing.

Compilation is the app's one genuinely expensive operation: a paper with a
bibliography needs four compiler passes and can take tens of seconds. The
gateway runs everything on ONE asyncio loop, so **nothing here may block it** —
every child process is spawned with :func:`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` and
awaited, and the two synchronous filesystem helpers (compiler discovery, the
``.bst``/``.bib`` search-path walk) are offloaded with :func:`asyncio.to_thread`
by their callers in this module.

Security notes that must not be relaxed:

* ``-no-shell-escape`` is passed **explicitly** on every pdflatex invocation.
  With shell escape enabled a ``\\write18{...}`` inside a ``.tex`` file is
  arbitrary command execution — and a ``.tex`` file here is untrusted content
  (the agent writes it, and a cloned repository supplies it wholesale). Tectonic
  does not enable shell escape unless asked (``-Z shell-escape``), and we never
  ask.
* The compiler spawn is routed through :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.sandboxed_spawn_argv`
  — the OS-level sandbox + credential-scrubbed env chokepoint — and carries
  :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.create_subprocess_limited`, so a runaway macro expansion
  gets a kernel-enforced ceiling instead of the host's whole memory.
* Every invocation is bounded by a wall-clock timeout and the process tree is
  killed on expiry.

    is killed and ``(-1, "")`` is returned — the caller reports a timeout rather
    than an empty success.

    ``mode="strict"``, NOT the ``"standard"`` default. Standard mode deliberately
    leaves ``~/.aws`` and ``~/.ssh`` readable so git-over-SSH and the AWS CLI keep
    working — a TeX compiler needs neither, and the input it runs on is a ``.tex``
    file that may have arrived by ``git clone`` from anywhere. TeX can read a file
    and typeset its contents, so ``\\input{../../../../.aws/credentials}`` under
    standard mode would render the operator's keys into the output PDF. That is a
    read no ``-no-shell-escape`` can stop, because it is not a shell escape.

    Strict on its own is NOT enough. Its credential list covers third-party
    locations (``~/.aws``, ``~/.gnupg``, ``~/.config/gcloud``) plus
    ``~/.kiro/crew/.env`` — but not the REST of KiroCrew's own trust root. The
    gateway's ``.local_secret``, ``sel_hmac.key``, ``security_policy.json``,
    ``profiles/`` and the other keystone files sit beside it, and TeX reads files:
    ``\\verbatiminput{~/.kiro/crew/.local_secret}`` would typeset the gateway's own
    callback credential into the PDF. So :func:`_sensitive_hidden_dirs` adds the
    read+write floor to ``extra_hidden_dirs``.

    Hiding the data home WHOLESALE and re-exposing this app's subtree does not
    work, and quietly does nothing: ``_hidden_path_contains_visible_path`` DROPS a
    hidden entry that contains any ``extra_visible_dirs`` path, so naming the
    project tree as visible would have cancelled the hiding altogether. The
    entries are therefore the individual sensitive paths, which do not contain the
    app's own data dir.

    ``gitops`` keeps the standard mode on purpose — pushing over SSH is the one
    place the key material is the point.

    The chokepoint itself is called OFF the loop. ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` →
    ``wrap_argv`` → ``detect_backend`` can cold-probe the sandbox backend with a
    synchronous ``subprocess.run(..., timeout=5)``, and on macOS nothing warms
    that cache first: ``prewarm_backend()`` returns early on non-Linux. So the
    first compile of the gateway's lifetime would stall the single loop — every
    chat session, cron tick and the liveness heartbeat — for up to five seconds.
    Linux is safe by construction (``_probe_unshare`` refuses to probe on the loop
    and defers to a thread), but the fix cannot be platform-conditional. Same form
    and same reason as ``apps/builtins/dev_fleet/server.py``.

    ``is_symlink()`` does NOT follow the link, so a dangling one is reported too — which
    is correct: the compiler would create the target wherever it points.

    **Why the whole tree and not the generated-artifact names.** Two earlier versions of
    this guard enumerated *names* — first a hand-written tuple of 8 suffixes, then the 17
    derived from ``store.ARTIFACT_SUFFIXES``. Both were unsound for the same reason, and
    the second only looked safer: a name list can answer "is ``main.pdf`` a link?" but
    the question the compiler actually poses is "is the file I am about to open a link?",
    and **the document chooses that filename**. ``\\openout\\ch=chapter1`` writes
    ``chapter1.tex``; ``\\jobname`` can be redirected; ``.bbl``/``.idx`` tool chains write
    names no suffix list predicts. Enumerating names loses that race by construction, so
    each round closed one instance and left the class open.

    Refusing on ANY link inverts it: the guard no longer has to predict what the compiler
    will write, because nothing beneath the project is a link at all. That is also the
    stance ``store.list_files`` already takes ("a link is not a file the editor should
    follow — and following one is how a tree walk escapes containment"), so a symlinked
    file was already invisible in the file list. This makes Compile agree with it rather
    than quietly following what the editor refuses to show.

    Bounded by ``store.MAX_PROJECT_FILES`` and does not descend INTO links, so a
    ``a -> ..`` cycle cannot spin it — same walk shape as ``list_files``. "Link" here
    means what ``store.is_reparse_link`` means, symlink OR Windows directory junction:
    a junction is the one link type a Windows user can create without elevation, so a
    symlink-only test leaves the cheapest bypass on that platform open.

    Returns ``(links, complete)``. **``complete`` is load-bearing and the caller MUST
    refuse when it is False.** The bound makes the walk terminate, but an exhausted
    budget means "did not finish looking", NOT "found nothing" — and the first version of
    this returned a bare list, so the two were indistinguishable and the caller read an
    unfinished scan as a clean one. That FAILED OPEN in precisely the case an attacker
    controls: a cloned repo padded with ``MAX_PROJECT_FILES`` earlier-sorting files
    exhausts the budget before the walk reaches ``main.pdf -> main.tex``, so the guard
    passed and pdflatex truncated the user's source. Demonstrated with the budget
    monkeypatched low, which is the same condition a padded repo produces.
