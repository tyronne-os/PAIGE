"""Papyrus — backend routes.

Registered on the gateway's own aiohttp application at startup (via the app's
``backend.routes`` manifest field, ``"backend.routes:register_routes"``), the same
shape as ``issue_radar`` and ``code_review_sage``. There is NO separate server
process and no port of its own: the upstream app ran a stdlib
``ThreadingHTTPServer``, which cannot participate in the gateway's auth, CSP, or
audit, and whose blocking ``subprocess.run`` calls would have to be re-plumbed
anyway.

Routes (browser-facing, same-origin authed):

  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/health                    -> {"status","compiler","git","managed"}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/compiler/provision        -> 202, then poll /health
  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/projects                  -> {"projects": [...]}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/projects                  {"name", "template"?}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/projects/clone            {"url", "name"?}
  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/project?name=<n>          -> {"name","main_file","files","has_pdf"}
  DELETE /api/apps/papyrus/project?name=<n>          -> {"ok": true}
  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/files?name=<n>            -> {"files": [...]}
  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/file?name=<n>&path=<p>    -> {"path", "content"}
  PUT    /api/apps/papyrus/file                      {"name","path","content"}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/file                      {"name","path","content"?}  (create)
  DELETE /api/apps/papyrus/file?name=<n>&path=<p>    -> {"ok": true}
  PUT    /api/apps/papyrus/main                      {"name","path"}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/compile                   {"name"} -> CompileResult
  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/pdf?name=<n>              -> application/pdf
  GET    /api/apps/papyrus/git?name=<n>              -> GitStatus
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/git/commit                {"name","message"?}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/git/push                  {"name"}
  POST   /api/apps/papyrus/git/pull                  {"name"}

Authorization is deny-by-default at three layers, in this order:

1. ``_require_enabled`` — the app is opt-in (``defaultEnabled: false``) but routes
   are registered once at startup, so every handler refuses with 403 while the app
   is disabled.
2. ``_project`` — the project name must be a single validated slug that resolves
   inside the app's own data dir (``store.safe_project_dir``), and the directory
   must exist. A name that fails either is a 400/404, never a filesystem touch.
3. ``store.safe_child`` — every relative path (read, write, create, delete, main
   selection) is re-validated against the resolved project root, which is what
   rejects traversal and symlink escapes.

Every blocking call — filesystem walks, file reads/writes, and the compiler and
git subprocesses — runs off the event loop. See the module docstrings in
``latex.py`` and ``gitops.py``.

**Path validation is itself blocking, and is offloaded too.** ``_project`` /
``_project_for_create`` / ``_safe_relative`` are the containment gate above, and
each one calls ``Path.resolve()`` plus a ``stat``-family probe — real syscalls,
which on a stalled network filesystem (a ``KIROCREW_HOME`` on NFS/SMB) block for
as long as the mount takes to answer. The gateway runs every session, cron job and
the liveness heartbeat on ONE asyncio loop, so a validation call left inline would
freeze all of them until the watchdog killed the process. Each handler therefore
groups its validation together with the filesystem work it authorizes into ONE
sync closure behind a single ``asyncio.to_thread`` hop.

Grouping is what keeps the ordering honest: validation still runs FIRST, and no
``await`` sits between the check and the use it authorizes, so the check/use
window is *narrower* than it was when the gate ran on the loop. The three
handlers that cannot group — ``clone``, ``compile`` and the four ``git`` routes,
whose next step is an ``await`` on a subprocess that needs the validated path —
take one hop for validation alone. ``web.HTTPException`` raised inside a worker
thread propagates through the ``await`` unchanged (and subclasses none of
``ValueError``/``OSError``/``FileExistsError``, so the handlers' ``except``
ladders cannot swallow it), which is what lets the gate keep answering 400/404/409
from off the loop. Pinned by ``test_papyrus_routes.py``
``::TestNoBlockingCallsOnTheLoop``.
