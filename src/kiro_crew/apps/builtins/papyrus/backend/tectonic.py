"""Papyrus — the managed, digest-pinned Tectonic compiler install.

A stock machine has no LaTeX compiler, so ``pip install kirocrew`` shipped this
app broken by default: every compile answered *"No LaTeX compiler found. Install
TeX Live (pdflatex) or tectonic."* Telling a first-run user to install TeX Live
is a multi-gigabyte errand, and there is no LaTeX compiler on PyPI (the
``tectonic`` name there is an unrelated placeholder — version ``0.0.0dev``, no
files). Tectonic itself is the answer: ONE self-contained static binary of
10-22MB that downloads only the TeX support files a document actually needs, and
that drives its own bibtex/rerun cycle — which :mod:`.latex` already knows about
(see its ``is_tectonic`` branches).

This module fetches that binary **on demand**, verifies it against a
per-platform sha256 pin, and installs it under the app's own data dir. It
follows :mod:`kiro_crew.embeddings`, the in-tree precedent for exactly this
problem: a large per-platform artifact fetched over plain HTTPS, sha256-pinned,
installed persistently under the data home, downloaded off the event loop with
retries, behind a status surface the UI can poll.

Why this is NOT the system-package install that ``pptx-maker`` deliberately
refuses
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``docs/system-specs/modules/pptx-maker.md`` records a product decision worth
restating here, because a reader could otherwise mistake this module for the
same mistake: that app's upstream shelled out to ``brew``/``apt-get`` from a
browser request, and *installing a system package is a host-level action a web
request must not take*. A test there pins the absence of ``POST /deps/install``.
That decision stands. This is a different act, and the differences are the
reason it is allowed:

* **No package manager and no privilege.** Nothing is elevated, no ``sudo``, no
  system installer is invoked. One archive is unpacked; nothing inside it is
  executed at install time.
* **Nothing is written outside this app's own data dir.** The binary lands in
  ``<data home>/apps/papyrus/data/vendor/tectonic/`` — never a system prefix,
  never ``/usr/local``, never a shell profile, and ``PATH`` is not mutated. The
  compiler is invoked by absolute path.
* **The bytes are pinned.** A sha256 per platform is verified before anything is
  installed, so the operator receives exactly the artifact this source names, or
  nothing.
* **It is reversible by deleting one directory** this app owns.

A user's own compiler always wins: :func:`.latex.find_compiler_sync` probes
``PATH`` and the userspace TeX Live locations BEFORE this managed install, so
provisioning can never displace a real TeX distribution.

Everything here is synchronous and blocking (network + filesystem). Callers MUST
stay off the event loop — see :func:`provision_in_background`, which runs the
work on a daemon thread, and the ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` rule.

#: The upstream release these digests were computed from.
