"""Path-segment names a POSIX filesystem accepts but Windows refuses.

Mochi mints most of its path segments itself (UUID4 pack ids), but two arrive
from outside: a petdex slug the user pastes, and an overwrite pack id sent by
the client. Both are validated by a character allow-list, which is the right
barrier for traversal and is complete on POSIX -- and incomplete on Windows,
which additionally reserves a set of legacy DOS device names in every
directory, and silently strips a trailing dot or space from a segment.
Neither rule is expressible as a character class, so it lives here.

This is deliberately NOT a security barrier: the callers' own allow-lists
already reject every separator and every illegal character, and this module is
consulted after them. It exists for two narrower reasons -- so a slug like
``con`` fails with a message the user can act on instead of an OSError raised
deep inside a file write, and so ``pet.`` and ``pet`` cannot name one directory
on Windows while naming two everywhere else.
