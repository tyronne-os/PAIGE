"""Mochi's own MCP server — the tools its agents call, over stdio.

WHY STDIO + FILES, not HTTP to the gateway
------------------------------------------
The original ran these tools inside the Electron main process and exposed them
on its own HTTP MCP port. Neither half of that survives the builtin migration:

* There is no second app to host a port, and hardcoding one is what the original
  got bitten by (a stale default pointing at nothing).
* An app *backend* would be a separate spawned process, but Mochi's autonomous
  core (``MochiRuntime``) lives in the GATEWAY process. Hosting tools in a second
  process would fork the state — two owner loops writing one queue.

So this is a stdio server that talks to the same JSON files the runtime owns.
That is not a workaround, it is how the original coordinated too: every one of
these tools went through ``queueFile`` / ``watchlistFile`` /
``pinnedFilesService``, which are atomic-write file stores. The owner loop
re-reads them every second, so a write here is picked up on the next tick. The
tool descriptions in the original say so outright: *"Actions are queued and
executed by the Electron app."*

Consequences worth knowing:

* No auth, no port discovery, no gateway dependency — the tools work whenever the
  data dir is readable, and cannot be broken by a gateway restart.
* Writes are atomic (``write_queue_atomic`` / ``write_atomic``), so a concurrent
  owner-loop read never observes a torn file.
* Latency to a VISIBLE effect is one owner-loop tick (≤1s), because the runtime,
  not this process, animates the pet.
