"""Pinned files for Mochi — pin list, JSON persistence, file-change tracking.

Ported from ``src/main/pinnedFilesService.ts``. The pet's side panel shows a
list of files the agent (or user) pinned; the service persists that list and
reports when a pinned file changes or disappears on disk.

PORTING NOTES
-------------

**The clock and both timers are injected.** The original read ``Date.now()`` in
three places (pinnedAt, updatedAt, the corrupted-backup filename) and ran two
kinds of ``setTimeout``: a 100ms per-file debounce on watch events, and a 1s
retry that re-establishes a watcher after a file vanishes (editors that save
via write-temp-then-rename briefly delete the file). As throughout
the ported modules, the owner drives time: mutating entry points take
``now_ms`` and ``tick(now_ms)`` fires whatever timers became due.

**Debounce and retry SHARE the per-file timer slot.** The original stored both
in one ``debounceTimers`` map keyed by path. Consequences that are behaviour,
not accident: ``_stop_watcher`` cancels whichever of the two is pending, and a
new watch event arriving during the retry window REPLACES the pending retry
with a fresh debounce. Both are preserved by keeping the single ``_timers``
dict.

**Replacing a timer moves it to the END of the dict.** ``clearTimeout`` + new
``setTimeout`` yields a new timer id, so when several timers share a deadline
the replaced one fires LAST. A plain ``dict[key] = value`` keeps the original
insertion position and would fire it first — hence pop-then-reinsert in
``on_watch_event``. Observable as broadcast order when two files' events land
on the same tick.

**An absent ``updatedAt`` key is the wire format, not ``None``.**
``JSON.stringify`` drops ``undefined`` properties, so both the persisted file
and every broadcast payload simply omit the key until a change is seen, and
``markSeen`` removes it again. The port stores the key only while set.

**OS-level file watching is the owner's job.** The original called ``fs.watch``
directly; Python has no stdlib equivalent and the gateway will wire its own
mechanism. The port keeps everything *around* the watcher that is observable —
the watched-path set, the exists-on-disk gate, the no-duplicate gate, start on
load/pin, stop on unpin/delete — and the owner feeds raw events into
``on_watch_event``.

**Watch events are NOT gated on a registered watcher.** The original
``handleWatchEvent`` never consulted the watchers map, so an event for a path
that was never pinned and does not exist still broadcasts
``pinned:file-deleted``. Preserved: it ships today, and the retry it schedules
is harmless (the pin check makes it a no-op).

**Garbage pin entries load, persist and round-trip unvalidated.** ``load``
checks only that ``pins`` is an array. JS property access on a non-object
yields ``undefined`` and never throws, so a numeric entry simply never matches
a path and never starts a watcher; ``_entry_path`` mirrors that.

    """The stored pin list could not be read into something a mutation can merge into.

    Raised only on the UPDATE path (:func:`read_pins_for_update`) so a mutation
    abandons itself instead of rewriting the whole file from a list it was never
    able to reconcile against what is on disk. Named and public because TWO
    PROCESSES mutate this file -- the gateway service below and the MCP server's
    ``pin_file`` / ``unpin_file`` -- and both have to recognise the refusal, so
    a module-private name would leave the second writer destroying what the
    first one just refused to touch.

    Modelled on ops-mission-control's ``CorruptDocumentError`` rather than the
    bare ``json.JSONDecodeError`` the aws-control readers raise (#7805): that
    app reached for the plain type only because the named one lived in another
    app, which does not apply to a type declared in the module both writers
    already import.

    The startup :meth:`PinnedFilesService.load` path deliberately does NOT raise
    this. There a corrupt file is replaced on purpose and preserved as a
    ``.bak.<now_ms>`` sidecar first (:meth:`_backup_corrupted`), which is a
    decision with a recovery copy, not a silent loss under someone else's write.

    """Read the stored pin list for a read-modify-write, REFUSING on corruption.

    Returns the stored list, or ``None`` when the file does not exist yet -- the
    one case where "nothing to carry forward" is true, so a first pin on a fresh
    install proceeds against an empty list.

    Every caller rewrites the WHOLE file from what this returns, so a read that
    failed must not degrade to a usable-looking answer: doing that writes the
    caller's own list over rows another process wrote and this one never loaded,
    and the unparseable file was their only remaining copy. Three shapes refuse,
    because each one reaches that same whole-file rewrite:

    * a parse failure -- the truncated bytes still hold most of the records
      verbatim, and only a person can recover them;
    * a read error the filesystem raised (a transient EACCES/EIO, a scanner
      holding the handle on Windows) -- the store is still there, this process
      just could not see it this instant;
    * valid JSON whose root is not an object, or whose ``pins`` is not a list --
      no parse failure at all, so left uncaught it would be the quietest loss of
      the three.

    Decoding is STRICT here, unlike :meth:`PinnedFilesService.load` and the Node
    original, which use ``errors="replace"``. That leniency only surfaces as a
    parse failure when the bad byte falls OUTSIDE a JSON string; inside a quoted
    value -- a pin label, or a path on a filesystem that does not enforce UTF-8 --
    it becomes U+FFFD, ``json.loads`` SUCCEEDS, and the whole-file rewrite then
    persists the mangled text. That is the same irreversible loss as the three
    refusals above, reached without any parse failure to catch it, so an
    undecodable byte is a fourth refusal rather than a repair. Found in review
    (GPT 5.6).

    ``load`` keeps the lenient decode: it does not write, and a corrupt file it
    accepts is preserved as a ``.bak.<now_ms>`` sidecar first. A mangled label
    read at startup can therefore reach memory, but it can no longer reach DISK,
    because every write path first re-reads through this reader and refuses.
