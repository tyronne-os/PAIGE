"""Queue file operations for Mochi's task queue (``mochi-queue.json``).

Ported from ``src/main/queueFile.ts``. Pure functions for filtering, routing and
updating the queue, plus atomic read/write.

PORTING NOTES — behaviours preserved deliberately, do not "fix" without a
decision:

* JavaScript's ``new Date(bad).getTime()`` is ``NaN``, and every comparison
  against ``NaN`` is false. That silently shapes three functions:
  - ``cleanup_done_tasks``: a done task with an unparseable ``executed_at`` is
    DROPPED (``NaN > cutoff`` is false).
  - ``get_executable_tasks``: a task with an unparseable ``execute_after`` is
    NOT executable (``NaN <= now`` is false).
  - ``route_poll``: an unparseable ``planned_until`` yields ``execute``, not
    ``plan`` (``NaN < now + ahead`` is false).
  ``_epoch_ms`` returns ``None`` for unparseable input and each call site spells
  out which way the comparison falls, so the asymmetry is visible rather than
  accidental.
* ``requires_agent`` is compared with strict ``=== true`` in the original, so a
  truthy-but-not-True value does NOT count against the agent budget. The port
  uses ``is True``.
* Warning strings are user-visible and are reproduced verbatim, including the
  single space joining the two possible warnings.

The ``now_ms`` parameter is injected everywhere the original read the wall clock
directly. The original called ``Date.now()`` inside three functions, which makes
differential testing impossible (two runtimes never agree on the millisecond).
Callers that want current time pass nothing and get ``time.time()``.
