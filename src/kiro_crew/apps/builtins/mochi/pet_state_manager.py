"""Pet state manager for Mochi — walking buffer, error auto-recovery, stats.

Ported from ``src/main/petStateManager.ts``. Wraps the pure transition table
(:mod:`pet_state_machine`) with the stateful behaviours around it:

* While walking, requested states are BUFFERED (``pending``) and applied when
  the walk finishes, so a think/work state landing mid-walk is not lost.
* ``finish_walking`` restores instantly for very short walks (< 300ms — the
  target was the current position) and after a 200ms delay otherwise, to
  avoid an idle flash between chained walks.
* Entering ``error`` arms a 3s auto-recovery (``timeout`` event).
* thinking-state edges feed the stats service (start/end of thinking time).

PORTING NOTES
-------------

Owner-driven timers, injected clock (the ``tick(now_ms)`` pattern): the error
auto-recovery and the 200ms walk-restore delay are deadlines fired by
``tick``. Both share the single ``state_timer`` slot, exactly like the
original's one ``stateTimer`` handle — arming either cancels the other, which
is load-bearing (``start_walking`` cancels a pending error recovery).

The stats coupling is injected (the original imported the ``statsService``
singleton; the port takes an optional ``StatsService`` — one more singleton
removed under the deviations policy).

Pinned by ``test/test_mochi_small_modules.py``.
