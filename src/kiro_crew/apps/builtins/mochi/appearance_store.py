"""Appearance-pack storage — the persistence behind the Avatars surface.

PORTED from the original's ``gallery:save-sprite-pack`` /
``appearanceRegistry`` pair (``main/ipcHandlers.ts``), which wrote packs into the
Electron app's ``userData/appearances/<packId>/``. Here the same layout lives
under Mochi's app data dir, so a pack survives independently of the shell:

    <data_dir>/appearances/<packId>/
        manifest.json       meta + state/mood -> filename maps + sprite config
        source.png          the original sheet, kept so a pack can be re-edited
        idle.png ...        one PNG per assigned state or mood

WHY A FILE TREE RATHER THAN THE SETTINGS STORE
A pack is several hundred KB of image data. ``settings.py`` is a small
atomically-rewritten JSON document read on every settings request; putting sprite
sheets in it would rewrite megabytes on every unrelated preference change.

The one behavior worth calling out, because losing it silently breaks re-editing:
overwriting a pack PRESERVES ``source.png`` when the caller does not supply a new
sheet. The original did this deliberately — the editor loads the source sheet to
re-slice it, so an overwrite that dropped it would leave the pack un-editable.
