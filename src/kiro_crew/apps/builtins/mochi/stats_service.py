"""Companion stats for Mochi — counters, streaks, milestones, memory snapshots.

Ported from ``src/main/statsService.ts`` (+ the stats helpers it pulled from
``shared/types.ts``). Spec: the characterization suite at
``statsService.characterization.test.ts`` (migration-only, not shipped)
(the module shipped with zero tests; ``statsFormatters.test.ts`` covers only
renderer formatting).

Quirks preserved (characterized, kept deliberately):

* Uptime accrual sets ``dirty`` but does NOT check milestones — a days-N
  milestone crossed by pure uptime is celebrated on the NEXT user action.
* Sleep heuristic: an uptime gap > 120s credits exactly 60s; a gap > 3h also
  resets ``earliestActiveTime`` and logs a wake-up, but only before local
  noon.
* ``busiestDay`` counts only SENT messages; today's running count resumes
  from the persisted record only when the dates match.
* Milestone baseline is seeded on load without firing (no stale-celebration
  burst for long-lived companions); seeding sets ``dirty`` but does not
  schedule a flush — the baseline persists on the next activity.

DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS from the TypeScript (authorized; each is a fix or a
KiroCrew-composition change, not a silent drift):

1. **No singleton, no hardcoded path.** The original baked
   ``~/Library/Application Support/DesktopBuddy/stats.json`` at module import
   and exported a shared instance. The port takes ``data_dir`` (KiroCrew data
   home) and keeps ``stats.json`` directly inside it.
2. **Deterministic number grouping.** Milestone texts used
   ``toLocaleString()``, whose output depends on the process locale. The port
   formats with explicit en-US comma grouping — what users actually saw.
3. **Atomic persistence.** The original ``writeFileSync`` could leave a
   truncated ``stats.json`` on crash; the port writes tmp+rename via
   ``atomic_write`` (0600). Read-side corruption recovery is kept regardless.

PORTING NOTES
-------------

Clock injected; both timers owner-driven. The 500ms flush debounce and the
60s uptime interval become deadlines fired by ``tick(now_ms)``, with the
original interleaving preserved: ``flush`` itself ticks uptime first, and the
uptime path can emit the memory-hour snapshot. Date/time strings are LOCAL
time on purpose — "busiest day" and "early bird" are user-facing calendar
concepts, so they follow the host clock, exactly like the original.
