"""Petdex.dev pet import — obtain a pet's spritesheet + metadata.

A petdex pet is two files: a spritesheet and a ``pet.json`` that carries only
``id`` / ``displayName`` / ``description`` / ``spritesheetPath``. It contains
**no state mapping** — the animation rows are a positional convention (8 cols x
9 rows of 192x208 frames, verified against the published assets). This module
therefore only OBTAINS the two files; deciding which row drives which Mochi
state is a user decision made in the Avatars importer, because a convention
that drifts upstream would otherwise mis-map every pet silently.

Two sources, both user-initiated:

* :func:`fetch_pet` — resolve a slug through ``petdex.dev/install/<slug>`` and
  download the two assets. This is an outbound request to a third party, so it
  is fenced: HTTPS only, host allow-list, byte caps, and a total timeout. The
  asset URLs come OUT of remote content, so they are re-validated against the
  same allow-list before being fetched — that is the injection surface here.
* :func:`list_installed` / :func:`read_installed` — read pets the user already
  installed with the petdex CLI (``~/.codex/pets/<slug>/``). No network.
