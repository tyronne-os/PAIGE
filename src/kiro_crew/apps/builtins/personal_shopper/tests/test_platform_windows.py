"""Windows support for the Personal Shopper app.

Two independent things are pinned here.

The manifest half: ``platform.os`` is a published capability label, not an
enable gate -- ``apps/routes.py`` only calls ``supports_platform(sys.platform)``
when ``platform.installMode == "client"``, which no builtin app sets, so this
app was never blocked from enabling on Windows regardless of what it declared.
The declaration is honest rather than optimistic: this app spawns no
subprocess and shells out nowhere, persists through stdlib sqlite3 with no
file locks, and builds every path with ``pathlib`` from ``app_data_dir``, so
there is no POSIX-only surface to carve out and nothing here degrades on
Windows.

The shutdown half: the module-level store singleton holds a WAL-mode sqlite
connection, and closing it is what makes the app resettable. On Windows an open
handle blocks deleting the files it points at, so an unclosed connection leaves
the app's data directory unremovable -- and the app therefore unresettable and
uninstallable -- once it has served a single request.
