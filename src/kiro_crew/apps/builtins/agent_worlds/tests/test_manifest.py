"""Platform + manifest-contract tests for the ``agent-worlds`` builtin app.

Agent Worlds is a MANIFEST-ONLY builtin: this directory's app.json is the whole
app, and its UI is a lazy-loaded page in the host bundle
(``website/src/pages/WorldsPage.tsx``, routed from
``website/src/apps/builtinRegistry.ts``). So the tests here validate the *static*
contract — which platforms the manifest claims, and the no-backend shape that
makes the Windows claim true — not runtime behaviour.

Everything resolves relative to this file, so the suite is machine independent.
