"""Platform-declaration contract tests for the Crew Companion builtin app.

Why Windows belongs in ``platform.os``
-------------------------------------
Crew Companion declares ``backend.hooks`` and ``backend.routes`` but no
``backend.entryPoint``, so the gateway never spawns a backend child process for
it -- the hooks and route handlers run in-process. Its own code is stdlib
filesystem and JSON work that is already platform-neutral (``platform_compat``
shims for POSIX modes and links, ``os.replace`` for atomic swaps, explicit
``encoding="utf-8"`` on every text read/write), so nothing in its path is
POSIX-only.

Omitting the block is not a neutral choice: the manifest then falls back to the
implicit ``["macos", "linux"]`` default, which misreports Windows support on the
App Store detail page a user reads before enabling the app -- ``platform.os`` is
a published capability label, not an enable gate (``apps/routes.py`` only calls
``supports_platform`` for a ``platform.installMode == "client"`` app, which no
builtin sets).

``requiresDesktopApp`` is a DIFFERENT axis and stays ``True``: it says the
companion needs the Electron desktop shell rather than a browser tab, which is
true on every OS. ``platform.os`` says which operating systems that shell may
run on. ``tests/test_manifest.py`` pins the desktop-app flag; this file pins the
OS list, so neither can be widened by accident while the other is edited.
