# Where Node toolchains actually live. The gateway spawns this backend with a
# minimal PATH — typically /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin — so `npm` is NOT
# resolvable by name even though it works fine in the user's terminal. Two things
# follow: the binary has to be found absolutely, AND the child's PATH has to
# include its directory, because `npm run dev` shells out to `node` itself.
# POSIX-only by nature: these are macOS/Linux install prefixes, and a directory
# that does not exist is simply dropped by `node_bin_dirs`, so on Windows the
# tuple contributes nothing and resolution falls back to PATH.

# `KIROCREW_PROXY_SECRET` is the whole of this backend's authentication: the
# gateway HMACs every proxied request with it (`kiro_crew.apps.proxy_auth`), and
# `_authorized()` refuses anything unsigned. Handing it to a project's `npm run
# dev` — arbitrary code from a folder the operator merely pointed at — would let
# that code forge signed calls straight to our loopback socket and bypass the
# gateway's token auth and per-app scope entirely.
#
# `PORT` is stripped because `minimal_env()` sets it to THIS backend's port
# (`apps/backend.py`); a dev server that honours `PORT` (Next, CRA, many Node
# servers do) would try to bind a socket we already hold and die on EADDRINUSE.
#
# `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` / `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` / `GIT_SSH` are stripped because the dev
# script is untrusted project code, not Kiro Crew's own: an inherited SSH agent
# socket or SSH override command lets it authenticate to a remote (`git push`,
# a bare `ssh`) AS the operator, with no confinement of its own — the same
# credential class `sandbox._SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` strips for the sandboxed
