"""Durable request and project state for the Design Tweak backend.

``server`` is the composition root and security-policy owner.  Functions that
depend on its mutable state or compatibility seams receive that module as
``runtime`` and resolve collaborators through it at call time, making the
server namespace the authoritative runtime boundary.

Queue mutations are whole-record read-modify-write transactions.  Their caller
must hold ``runtime._QUEUE_LOCK`` from the first read through the final write or
rename.  Socket I/O, subprocess work, and response writes must remain outside
that critical section.
