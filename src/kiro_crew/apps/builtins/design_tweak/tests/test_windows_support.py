"""Windows-support assertions for the Design Tweak backend.

Two things are pinned here: the manifest's platform declaration, and the code
paths that decided whether the app could honestly claim Windows at all.

The load-bearing one is owned dev-server port discovery. `detect_dev_servers`
answers "which listener belongs to this folder" through port -> pid -> working
directory, and this repo has no cross-platform source for that second hop. When
that was the ONLY channel, starting a project's dev server on a host without
`lsof` spawned a healthy server, failed to find its port for 45s, killed it, and
told the user it never started listening. The second channel closes that, and
these tests pin both its success case and — more importantly — its refusals.
