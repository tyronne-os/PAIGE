"""Dynamic Workflow template for Research Lab v2 'workflow' execution mode.

``RESEARCH_WORKFLOW_SOURCE`` is a sandboxed dynamic-workflow script (the string
the gateway hands to ``WorkflowService.start(source=...)``). It encodes
the research methodology as a deterministic recursive scaffold — plan → explore
(investigate top-K → discover follow-ups → synthesis-check) → finalize — with the
LLM only at the leaf ``ctx.agent()`` calls. Reserve-and-finalize: the final
``ceil(max_rounds * reserve_fraction)`` rounds are reserved so the run always
synthesizes a report instead of exploring to the cap.

This module itself is ordinary (non-sandboxed) Python — only the SOURCE string is
executed inside the workflow sandbox, so it obeys the engine's constraints: no
imports, no eval/open/getattr/dunder, ``META`` pure-literal + ``async def
workflow(ctx)``, and only the safe builtins + the ``ctx`` surface. It is validated
by ``kiro_crew.workflows.validate.validate``.
