"""The Pull+Build sync runner, as a real module instead of a string literal.

This is the program that :func:`server._sync_start_locked` used to assemble from
Python source and hand to ``[sys.executable, "-c", <string>]``. That form had one
defect the code itself was blameless for: no linter parsed it, and its only tests
string-matched the source. So the transaction that moves ``node_modules`` aside
and puts it back on failure -- the part whose whole point is not to lose a
dependency tree -- was unreachable by an executing test. Extracting it here makes
every branch a real function a test can drive against a real directory tree.

It mirrors :mod:`npm_preflight`'s discipline exactly, and for the same reasons:

* **Stdlib only.** It imports nothing from ``kiro_crew``. Everything that would
  otherwise come from the package -- the reserved exit codes, the one step label
  allowed to assert a diagnosis -- is passed IN, on the command line or the
  environment, never interpolated into source and never imported. That is what
  lets it be snapshotted out and run BY PATH: what it does cannot change with the
  revision being merged underneath it.

* **Run by path, never by module.** ``server`` copies this file's bytes into an
  ``mkdtemp`` snapshot and invokes ``[sys.executable, <snapshot_path>, ...]``.
  ``-m kiro_crew...sync_runner`` would import it from the working tree AFTER the
  merge has landed, dragging the whole package ``__init__`` chain in with it -- so
  a merged revision that raised the ``requires-python`` floor with newer syntax
  anywhere in that chain would ``SyntaxError`` while being parsed. Executing the
  copied file keeps the only parsed file one the launching interpreter already
  ran. The snapshot-not-import rule is an invariant, not a convenience.

The step list arrives as JSON from a FILE PATH argument, never embedded in the
source, so a non-ASCII checkout path in a step's argv or env cannot break the
program that reads it.

The exit code IS the diagnosis. The reserved codes come from :mod:`npm_preflight`
(passed in as ``--reserved``); this runner is the thing that enforces the
reservation -- a reserved code from any step other than the one trusted label is
DEMOTED to a plain failure, because every other step runs worktree-controlled
code that can exit any number it likes. stdout carries only human-readable log
text; nothing printed here is promoted into the authoritative diagnosis.

    transaction restoring a PARTIAL tree over a good one. So the load-bearing
    deletions are CONFIRMED, and one that will not complete stops the step with

    intact backup unclaimed, and the next run's recovery then sat behind every
