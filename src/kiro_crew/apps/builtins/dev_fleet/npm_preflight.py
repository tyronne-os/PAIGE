"""Pre-merge installability probe for Dev Fleet's Pull+Build frontend half.

``npm ci`` DELETES ``node_modules`` before it installs. So a registry that
refuses one package turns a sync into damage rather than a no-op: the tree is
emptied, the run aborts mid-reify, and the checkout is left with new source, a
new lockfile, and no frontend dependencies at all. Re-pressing Pull+Build
repeats the deletion.

This module answers the one question that prevents that, BEFORE the merge
lands: *can the incoming lockfile be installed at all?* It reads the lockfile
out of the fetched ref (``git show``) rather than the working tree, so it can
run between ``fetch`` and ``merge`` — the only point where the new lockfile is
already knowable and nothing has been applied yet. A refusal there costs
nothing, because ``fetch`` only moves remote refs.

Two things it deliberately is NOT:

* It is NOT a registry auth check. A dead registry token is invisible to a
  build whose packages are all in npm's local cache, because cacache retrieval
  is integrity-addressed: a tarball already on disk satisfies its lockfile
  entry with no network and no credentials. A ``npm ping``-style probe would
  therefore fail while the very install it guards would have succeeded — it
  would block good syncs and teach operators to ignore it. Asking
  "is this installable" instead is both narrower and correct, and it is
  registry-agnostic: it holds for a public registry, a private mirror, or an
  air-gapped cache alike.
* It does NOT run the package tree's lifecycle scripts (``--ignore-scripts``).
  The probe exists to answer a question, not to execute the worktree's install
  hooks a second time; skipping them also keeps the probe strictly less
  privileged than the step it guards.

It performs a REAL install into a disposable directory rather than
``npm ci --dry-run``, and that is not a preference. A dry run does not attempt
retrieval at all: against a lockfile pinning a tarball that 404s, measured,
``npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts`` exits 0 and reports "added 1 package"
while the same command without ``--dry-run`` exits 1 on the missing tarball. A
dry run would therefore pass exactly the case this module exists to catch, so
the probe has to fetch. That install is cheap next to the emptied
``node_modules`` it prevents -- and it is no longer paid on every sync:
:func:`_install_already_proven` skips it when the incoming ref touches nothing
under ``website/`` and a populated tree is already there to answer for it.

The flags otherwise MIRROR the real step exactly. A probe that resolves
differently from the install is worse than no probe: it either passes what will
fail, or fails what would have worked. ``--no-audit``/``--no-fund`` are the only
additions, and neither participates in resolution.

The distinct exit codes do NOT drive a cross-process protocol: the runner only
tests non-zero, and nothing outside this module reads which code came back. What
the classification is for is :func:`explain` -- turning a failure into one
registry-neutral sentence the dashboard can show instead of npm's log-file
pointer. Keeping the codes separate is what makes that sentence specific, and
what lets a caller tell a host condition (a full scratch filesystem) from a
lockfile that genuinely cannot be installed.

    """Reason to SKIP the probe install, or ``None`` to run it.

    The probe answers "can the INCOMING lockfile be installed?", and it pays a
    real script-free install to answer honestly. But when the incoming ref
    changes NOTHING under ``website/``, that question has already been put to
    disk: no new resolution is arriving, and a populated ``node_modules`` sits
    beside the one that is already there. Re-deriving it costs a full scratch
    install on every backend-only sync -- the common case, since most syncs move
    Python and never touch the frontend half at all.

    Both halves are load-bearing, and the skip is refused unless both hold:

    * **The whole frontend subtree is unchanged**, not merely its resolution
      inputs. Comparing only ``package-lock.json`` / ``package.json`` /
      ``.npmrc`` was not enough, and the gap is worth stating because it is
      subtle: with those three identical but frontend SOURCE changed, a skipped
      probe lets the merge land, and a failing ``npm ci`` afterwards leaves the
      checkout with new source and the previously-built bundle. Requiring the
      entire subtree to be identical makes that unreachable -- with no frontend
      change there is no new bundle to be missing, so a failed sync leaves the
      frontend byte-for-byte as it was.
    * **A populated tree to point at.** With no ``node_modules`` there is no
      evidence at all -- so a fresh checkout's first sync still probes, which is
      exactly when the answer is least known. Populated rather than merely
      present, because an interrupted ``npm ci`` can leave an empty directory
      behind and an empty tree proves nothing.

      Be precise about what populated does NOT prove: it is evidence, not a
      verified install. A prior FRONTEND sync whose post-merge ``npm ci`` died
      partway can leave a partial tree beside the merged lockfile, and a later
      backend-only sync will skip on it -- the subtree is unchanged from there
      on, so nothing re-examines it. That stays benign for the same reason the
      dead-registry residual does: the skip decides only whether this sync PAYS
      for a rehearsal, so a refusal lands one step later instead of never, and
      the transaction keeps the checkout consistent either way. The evidence test
      tracked in #7132 should cover this scenario and not only the interrupted
      one.

    What makes skipping SAFE rather than merely cheap is where a failure lands.
    The probe exists because ``npm ci`` deletes ``node_modules`` first, so a
    refusal after the merge used to leave new source beside an emptied tree.
    Under this condition that outcome is not reachable: the runner's transaction
    moves the tree aside and puts it back on any non-zero step, the lockfile did
    not change, and neither did the source the bundle was built from.
    A skipped probe can only leave a state a later ``npm ci`` fixes.

    ``git diff`` rather than a byte comparison of the resolution files, because
    the question is about the whole subtree and git already answers exactly that
    against the working tree. Anything it cannot answer -- a failing or missing
    git, a timeout -- returns ``None`` and the probe runs, so the unknown case
    costs an install rather than a guarantee.
