"""Design Critique — backend API routes.

Registered at gateway startup by the ``BUILTIN_NAMES`` loop in
``dashboard/routes/system.py`` (via the package re-export in
``design_critique/__init__.py``).

These endpoints do every step that needs a shell or the filesystem — cloning a
repo, discovering its routes, and rendering screens to PNGs — server-side, so the
LLM agent never has to. The agent is then only ever asked to reason over finished
images with no tools, which is why it can no longer stall on a tool-approval
prompt that the app panel has nowhere to show.

Routes (browser-facing, same-origin authed):

  GET  /api/apps/design-critique/method    -> the critique method text to inline
  POST /api/apps/design-critique/discover  -> {kind,value} -> candidate screens
  POST /api/apps/design-critique/render     -> {kind,value,handle,picks} -> PNGs

# retained past discover with a handle-keyed route->PNG map recorded here, and
# /render reuses one for any picked route the probe covered, shelling out only for
# the rest.

#   {"dir": <retained probe dir>, "routes": {<route>: <abs png path>},

# a write is installed only if no newer discovery of the same handle has begun, so an

#
# It has to live outside the cache entry, because every discovery evicts the handle's
# entry before it captures — so a stamp kept in the entry would be gone by the time a
# slower, older discovery tried to write, which is precisely when it is needed. The
# stamp is therefore a HIGH-WATER MARK that eviction RAISES rather than clears.
#
# Only stable "local:<path>" handles can genuinely interleave (a repo handle is a
# fresh clone id per discovery), but the guard is unconditional: the cost is one int,

    post-build bytes while the PNGs depict pre-build ones, and /render would match and

    leaves no file behind to carry a recent mtime, so files alone would miss one.

    capture-build.mjs never builds anything: it serves the already-built output it
    finds under the project dir, so a reused PNG depicts ``build_dir``'s contents,
    NOT the project root's. Signing the project root would miss the case this guard
    exists for, because a directory's own st_mtime moves only when its direct
    entries change and an ordinary rebuild writes underneath an already-existing
    ``dist/``.

    The token digests every file the static server will actually serve — each one's
    relative path, size and ``st_mtime_ns`` — so an ordinary write moves it, including
    an in-place overwrite of a nested file under an unchanged name. The walk is sorted,
    so the token describes the tree rather than the order the filesystem happened to
    enumerate it in.

    It is metadata, not content: a rewrite that keeps a file's byte count identical AND
    restores its original ``st_mtime_ns`` (a deliberate ``utime``, or an archive
    extracted with preserved timestamps) is not detected. Hashing the bytes instead
    would mean reading the whole build output on every /render, which can cost more
    than the capture the reuse saves, and the reuse window (``_PROBE_REUSE_TTL_SEC``)
    already bounds how long such a rewrite could matter. Size-and-mtime is the same
    token build tools themselves rely on.

    "Will actually serve" is capture-build.mjs's own index, and the two enumerations
    have to agree: signing something the server never serves yields false mismatches
    and needless re-captures, while MISSING something it does serve lets a stale PNG
    through. That script indexes with a readdir Dirent test that counts neither a
    symlinked directory nor a symlinked file as one, and skips dot-entries, so none
    of those is ever reachable over the preview server — and none is signed here.

    Returns ``None`` whenever the served set cannot be read in full: missing,
    unreadable, or larger than ``_SIGNATURE_MAX_FILES``. A caller MUST treat ``None``
    as "unknown" rather than "unchanged" and refuse reuse — a token over part of a
    tree is no evidence about the rest.

    This walks and stats a caller-supplied path that may be a stale NFS/UNC mount,
    so callers on the event loop MUST reach it through ``asyncio.to_thread``.

    A returned screen path is kept FOREVER by a saved critique's history entry, which

    its dc-probe-* dir is swept on _CLONE_TTL_SEC and is deleted outright when the
    same local project is re-discovered. Handing the probe path straight to the
    client would therefore make saved critiques lose their screenshots, so the bytes
    are adopted into the render dir and only the copy is ever returned. The copy
    costs milliseconds; the capture subprocess is still skipped.

    A copy that fails (the probe dir was swept, or rmtree'd by a concurrent local
    re-discovery, between the handler's exists() check and here) is omitted from the
    result. The caller must then treat that ref as UNCOVERED and capture it fresh:
