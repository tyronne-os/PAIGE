"""Dependency resolver — install and clean up app dependencies.

Handles three types of capability dependencies (mcp, skills, agents) and system
command checks. Non-blocking — failures are recorded but don't prevent
app installation.

Capability dependencies resolve through the ``CapabilityManager`` CPP seam
(``platform/interfaces.py``): the edition owns which package manager backs them,
its invocation grammar, and its error translation — the core only calls an
operation and records the outcome.  The public edition ships no capability
manager (``available()`` is ``False``), so such entries are recorded as
unresolved instead of shelling out to any named binary.
