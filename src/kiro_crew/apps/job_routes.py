"""The shared ``_jobs/*`` HTTP surface for the Job SDK.

Mounted ONCE for every app rather than per app: the routes carry ``{app}`` as a
path segment and resolve that app's :class:`JobSDK` from the process registry —
the same shape the Route Registry catch-all and the app API proxy already use.
A per-app loop would need the app list at registration time, which is not known
until the enable loop runs.

Registration must happen BEFORE ``RouteRegistry.ensure_catch_all()`` installs
``/api/apps/{app_name}/{path:.*}``, because aiohttp matches in registration
order and that catch-all would otherwise swallow ``_jobs`` and answer with the
app's own dispatch table instead.

Authorization. These paths sit inside ``/api/apps/{app}``, which
``_app_owns_path`` grants to that app's own token unconditionally, and the
conventional ``/api/apps/<app>/*`` manifest grant covers them too — so a
consuming app needs no new ``permissions.api`` entry. On top of that this
surface is deliberately OWNER-GATED like the account portal: ``start`` runs real
work with real side effects, and P1 ships with no consumer that needs an
app-token caller, so the narrower gate is the one that ships. Opening it to app
tokens is a later, deliberate change with its own review, not a default.

    """The record as the browser sees it.

    ``origin`` and ``pid`` are host facts with no client meaning, so they are
    withheld. Everything else the record holds is served: P1's record has no
    caller- or runner-supplied payload to decide about, which is why there is no
    per-field withholding rule here any more.

    ``cancelling`` is one of two fields NOT read off the record. It says a cancel
    has been asked for and the worker has not reached the checkpoint where it
    records the outcome, and it comes from the SDK's live table via
    ``cancelling_and_live_ids`` because ``cancel`` deliberately writes nothing -- see that
    method for why persisting it would break the single-writer rule.
    ``cancelling`` is a REQUIRED argument rather than a defaulted one so that a
    future caller cannot quietly serve ``false`` by forgetting to pass it; a
    missing argument is a type error at the call site instead of a wrong answer
    in the response.

    ``live`` is the other, from the same table via ``cancelling_and_live_ids``:
    whether THIS gateway process holds the run in its live table -- claimed at
    start, dropped after the terminal write. A durable record can carry
    ``running`` with nothing owning it -- a terminal write that failed twice,
    or a record minted by another gateway process -- and ``live`` is the only
    signal that lets a client tell that stale record from real work; ``origin``
    and ``pid`` stay withheld. It is REQUIRED for the same reason
    ``cancelling`` is.

    A terminal run is never ``cancelling`` and never ``live``. The worker
    writes the record before ``_execute`` drops the live entry, so a read
    landing between those two would otherwise report ``status: cancelled`` and
    ``cancelling: true`` together -- the cancel both finished and still
    pending -- or a finished run as still driven. Once the status carries the
    answer there is nothing left to be pending or driven.

    ``interrupted_from`` and ``interrupt_cause`` are served for the reason they
    exist. They are not host facts -- they are the two facts a client needs to
    recover from an interruption, and a client is the only party that can act on
    them: whether the run may have committed side effects, and whether retrying
    it is even possible now. Withholding them would leave the record honest and
    the API not.

    ``work_observed`` is served for the same reason: a client deciding whether a
    ``done`` run actually did its work, or whether a ``failed`` one may have
    committed a side effect before it stopped, reads the observed fact rather than
    re-deriving it. It is an SDK-minted boolean, not a runner payload, so serving
    it carries none of the sanitizing cost the P2 result channel does.
