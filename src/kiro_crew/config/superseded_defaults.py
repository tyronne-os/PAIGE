"""Detect stored config values that still hold a superseded dataclass default.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``config.json`` is written as a FULL materialization of the schema: every field
lands on disk, including ones the operator never set. The loader then resolves
each field as ``data.get(key, DEFAULT)``, so a stored value always beats the
dataclass default. The consequence is that changing a shipped
default only reaches installs created after the change -- every pre-existing
install keeps whatever value was materialized the last time it wrote config, and
nothing tells anyone.

Why this REPORTS and never rewrites
-----------------------------------
An earlier revision corrected the stored value. That cannot be done safely for a
key that also has a documented escape hatch, and at least one does:
``test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off`` in the gateway env suite pins that an
explicitly stored ``forward_declared_env: false`` is honoured, and calls it "the
escape hatch for a server that must not share a backend". On disk that escape
hatch and a stale materialized default are the SAME BYTES, so no rewrite can tell
them apart -- correcting one necessarily overrides the other.

Distinguishing them needs per-key provenance (which keys the operator actually
set), which is a materially larger change to the config layer and its own piece
of work. Until that exists, the honest scope is to make the drift VISIBLE and
leave the change to the operator: a warning on the gateway's own log and a
``doctor`` section naming the key, the stored value, the current default, and the
release that changed it.

Why the report is acknowledgeable
---------------------------------
Value equality alone cannot falsify a report, so an operator who deliberately
chose a value that happens to equal a superseded default would be told about it
on every load, forever, with no way to answer. Worse, the registry is
append-only: each new entry adds another permanent line, and a section that is
mostly unanswerable noise is a section operators learn to skip -- which costs
exactly the genuine drift the mechanism exists to surface.

So the report is falsifiable. :func:`acked_superseded` reads an
acknowledgment file recording ``<dotted key> -> the value that was acked``, and a
key whose STORED value still equals its acked value is not reported. The value is
recorded rather than a bare key name so the acknowledgment covers the choice, not
the key: change the value later and the report returns.

The acknowledgment lives in its own file, NOT in ``config.json``, because a full
``to_dict()`` rewrite carries only schema fields -- the same materialization
behaviour that created this whole problem would silently drop an ack stored
anywhere in the config document. Losing the file is harmless by construction: it
changes no runtime behaviour, only whether one line is printed.

Scope discipline
-----------------
Nothing here writes to CONFIGURATION. Detection is pure; :func:`drop_drifted_keys`
mutates a dict handed to it by a caller that already owns the config lock;
:func:`record_acks` opens ``config.json`` only to READ it, under that same lock,
because acknowledging a value it did not just read would record a stale one. The
one file this module writes is the acknowledgment file, which holds no settings.

Rendering splits by who asked. ``doctor``'s section lives HERE, reading
``config.json`` directly, so the config package stays the one place that knows what
the stored document means. ``kirocrew config defaults`` lives in ``cli_config``,
because deciding what to DO about drift -- adopt, affirm, or just look -- is the
CLI's job, and it calls into the helpers above rather than reimplementing them.

    """Print the ``Stored Defaults`` section of ``kirocrew doctor``.

    Reads ``config.json`` DIRECTLY rather than the resolved config, and does not
    merge ``config.local.json``: the question is what the base file has
    materialized, and the resolved view cannot answer it -- a stored value and the
    same value arriving from the current default are indistinguishable once parsed.

    Drift is informational and does NOT become an issue. This cannot tell a stale
    materialized default from a deliberate opt-out (on disk they are identical), so
    presenting it as something to fix would be telling operators to undo their own
    choices. It prints what is stored, what the current default is, and which
    release changed it, and leaves the decision with them. An unreadable or
    non-object config IS an issue: that is unambiguously wrong.

    An acknowledged entry is shown here rather than suppressed. An ack answers the
    UNSOLICITED load-path line; ``doctor`` is the question "what does this install
    still hold?", and hiding an affirmed value would make the answer wrong.

    ``config_path`` is imported lazily because ``config.loader`` imports this
    module for the load-path warning, so a module-level import would be a cycle.
