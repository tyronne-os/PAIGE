"""Config validation + the validated-data cache for KiroCrew.

Extracted from ``config/loader.py`` so the schema-driven validation logic and
the process-global validated-config cache live apart from the config DTO
definitions and the loader's read/merge orchestration.

What lives here:
- Schema-introspection helpers (``_is_sensitive_path``, ``_mask_value``,
  ``_apply_field_default``, …) used while validating.
- ``validate_config_data()`` — runs jsonschema validation, logs human-readable
  warnings, and removes invalid values in-place so the loader falls back to
  field defaults. Never raises.
- ``ConfigCache`` — a small wrapper around the process-global validated-data
  cache, with an explicit ``clear()`` (replacing the bare module globals that
  were impossible to reset/inject in tests).

What deliberately stays in ``config/loader.py``:
- ``_config_fingerprint()`` — it reads ``config_path()`` / ``config_local_path()``,
  which the test suite patches via ``kiro_crew.config.loader.config_path``; keeping
  it there preserves that monkeypatch seam. The loader computes the fingerprint
  and passes it in, so this module never resolves config paths itself.

Logging note: config-validation warnings ("unrecognized top-level keys",
"deprecated field", "enum violation", …) are emitted on the
``kiro_crew.config.loader`` logger — not this module's ``__name__`` logger — to
preserve the loader's observable warning channel (asserted by the test suite).
All names here are re-exported from ``config/loader.py`` for backward
compatibility.

#: Exact dot-paths whose malformed values must SURVIVE advisory validation.
#:
#: ``_apply_field_default`` repairs a violating value by removing it so the
#: loader falls back to defaults. Whether that repair is safe depends on the
#: DIRECTION of the field's default:
#:
#: * ``publish`` (the section) and ``publish.allowed_destinations``: the
#:   default is **open** (no restriction), so repairing a malformed narrowing
#:   silently widens it to allow-all with no denial and no audit record.
#:   The loader's recording coercion (``_coerced_section``) and the
#:   gate's fail-closed checks are the honest handlers — but they can only run
#:   if validation leaves the evidence in place. Keeping the value also keeps
#:   security behaviour identical whether or not ``jsonschema`` is installed
#:   (validation is a no-op without it), which is the split that let this gap
#:   ship unnoticed.
#:
#: * Every OTHER publish field stays repairable, deliberately. For a field
#:   whose default is **restrictive** the repair is the safe direction, and
#:   preserving the malformed value can itself widen: a dict-shaped
#:   ``publish.relocate_roots`` of ``{"/etc": false}`` iterates as its keys in
#:   the loader's comprehension and would inject ``/etc`` as an allowed
#:   relocate root, where the repaired default ``[]`` means home-only.
#:
#: * ``dashboard`` (the section) and ``dashboard.tailscale``: same open
#:   direction, one narrowing deeper. ``dashboard.tailscale.allowed_logins``
#:   is the ONLY restriction on which tailnet peer may authenticate, and its
#:   default is the empty list — which the loader turns into
#:   ``trust_identity = False``, i.e. **no login restriction at all**. So
#:   repairing either enclosing object dropped the operator's allowlist and
#:   admitted every tailnet peer holding a token, where before only an
#:   allowlisted login was admitted. Note the deeper
#:   ``dashboard.tailscale.allowed_logins`` itself needs no entry: at three
#:   segments it is already past ``_apply_field_default``'s depth cap, so a
#:   malformed list value is kept today.
#:
#: Exact-match only: this is a per-path judgment, not a subtree rule. The
#: registry is only half of a fix — a preserved value changes nothing unless
#: the loader RECORDS the degradation and a gate reads
#: ``KiroCrewConfig.degraded_sections``. Both halves exist for every path
#: listed here; adding a path without them just keeps evidence nobody reads.

# handlers, the write-back migration) never corrupt the shared cache.
