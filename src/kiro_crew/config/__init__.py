"""Config package.

The public config surface (``KiroCrewConfig`` and the path helpers) is exposed
lazily via :pep:`562` ``__getattr__`` so that importing a lightweight submodule
such as :mod:`kiro_crew.config.paths` does NOT eagerly pull in the heavy
``kiro_crew.config.loader`` (DTOs, schema validation, the process-global cache,
and the lazily-imported provider factory). ``from kiro_crew.config import X``
continues to work for every name in ``__all__`` — it just resolves on first
access instead of at package import.
