#     would resurrect a channel or an allow-list the caller just cleared.
#   * ``observe_max_messages`` / ``observe_ttl_hours`` are stored on the
#     TOP-LEVEL config object, not on SlackConfig, and to_dict() writes them into
#     the slack section unconditionally. Capturing them would be pure noise.

    """Unknown keys found INSIDE a modelled section, per section.

    The top-level counterpart of this is ``_extra_sections``: a whole section
    this core does not model survives a load/save round-trip. A key nested one
    level down had no such protection, so when a build stopped modelling
    ``<section>.<key>`` — a rename, a removal, or simply an older config written
    by a newer edition — the load ignored it and the next ``save()`` (triggered
    by anything at all: a log-level change, adding a workspace, editing an
    agent) rewrote the file without it. The operator's value was gone, silently,
    with no backup on that path.

    Two shapes of section are covered. A dataclass-backed section yields
    ``{key: value}``. A map of named records (``_RECORD_MAP_SECTIONS``) yields
    ``{record_name: {key: value}}``, because each record is itself parsed
    field-by-field and would otherwise lose its unmodelled keys the same way.
    ``hooks`` is neither: it is emitted raw and round-trips whole.

    A key is recognized — and so NOT captured — when it is a field of the
    section's dataclass (including private carriers, which to_dict() drops on
    purpose), when it is listed in ``_SECTION_KEYS_EMITTED_ELSEWHERE`` or
    ``_SECTION_KEYS_DELIBERATELY_DROPPED``, or when it starts with an underscore.
    Note what this deliberately does NOT cover: a key the schema DOES model but
    validation rejected (a bad enum value from an older build) stays dropped,
    because re-emitting it would make the rejection permanent and re-warn on
    every load.

    Capture is a no-op safety net rather than an override: to_dict() restores a
    captured key only if the emitted section lacks it, so a stale copy can never
    clobber a live value.
