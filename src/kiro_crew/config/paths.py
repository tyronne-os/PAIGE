"""Pure filesystem path primitives for KiroCrew configuration.

This is a **leaf module**: it depends only on the standard library
(``os``, ``sys``, ``pathlib``, ``logging``) and imports nothing from
``kiro_crew`` at import time. The one exception is a lazy, in-function import
of :mod:`kiro_crew.atomic_write` inside ``_write_recovery_breadcrumb`` (that
helper itself imports this module lazily, so there is no cycle). Modules that
only need to locate ``~/.kirocrew/`` should import
from here directly::

    from kiro_crew.config.paths import config_dir

so they don't transitively pull in the full config loader (DTOs, schema
validation, the process-global cache, and the lazily-imported provider
factory) the way ``from kiro_crew.config.loader import config_dir`` does.

Only the genuinely pure primitives live here. The *dir-derived* helpers
(``config_path``, ``config_local_path``, ``workspace_root``, ``workspace_dir_for``,
``outbox_dir``, ``env_path``, …) remain in :mod:`kiro_crew.config.loader` so that
their ``config_dir()`` lookups resolve in the loader namespace — preserving the
``patch("kiro_crew.config.loader.config_dir", ...)`` test seam used across the
suite.

All names here are also re-exported from ``kiro_crew.config.loader`` for
backward compatibility, so existing callers continue to work unchanged.

    3. Not yet resolved -> delegate to :func:`config_dir`, so the FIRST
       resolution in a process still creates the home and refreshes the
       breadcrumb exactly once, per *start*.

    Deliberately NOT a cache of its own: case 1 must stay live, and case 2 reads

    temp resident that is a durable install in disguise: an AppImage's runtime
    mount, excluded at that call site via :func:`_in_ephemeral_tree`. This
    predicate stays a plain "is it under the temp root" answer so each caller
    keeps its own exemptions.

    ``/tmp`` -> ``/private/tmp``, ``/var/folders`` -> ``/private/var/folders``)
    and a symlink into the tree land in the same namespace.

    TWO roots are answered against, not one. ``tempfile.gettempdir()`` is the
    root as configured AT CALL TIME (it honours ``$TMPDIR``), matching how the
    rest of this module treats redirected environments — but on macOS launchd
    sets ``$TMPDIR`` to a per-user ``/var/folders/.../T``, so ``gettempdir()``
    alone does NOT contain ``/tmp``, and ``/tmp/<scratch clone>`` would read as
    durable there. POSIX ``/tmp`` is
    therefore checked as well: it is reaped on reboot by contract, so nothing
    durable lives under it. ``/var/tmp`` deliberately is not: POSIX has it
    PRESERVED across reboots, which is the opposite claim.

    That literal is added on POSIX ONLY. ``Path("/tmp")`` is drive-RELATIVE on
    Windows, so ``.resolve()`` anchors it to the current drive and yields
    ``C:\\tmp`` — a path with none of the reboot-reaped meaning the rule rests on,

def kiro_home() -> Path:
    """Return the kiro home (``~/.kiro``), honoring a ``KIRO_HOME`` override.

    ``KIRO_HOME`` is kiro-cli's own documented override for its user-level
    directory. Honoring it here is what lets the agents directory — the specs that
    define which MCP servers exist — stop being unconditionally machine-wide, so a
    non-default instance can be told to own its own copy instead of rewriting the
    real install's (see ``agent._decline_shared_agent_home`` for what that
    rewriting costs: managed MCP servers that read one credential while calling a
    gateway that expects another, and 403 on every call).

    SCOPE CAVEAT — read before setting this. ``KIRO_HOME`` redirects kiro-cli's
    WHOLE user directory (agents, prompts, skills, steering, settings, sessions),
    but KiroCrew currently resolves the host ``~/.kiro`` for most of those readers
    (session transcripts in ``session_map.py`` / ``acp/*`` / ``providers/acp.py``
    / ``dashboard/handlers/usage.py``, and the ``settings/mcp.json`` registry).
    Setting ``KIRO_HOME`` therefore moves where kiro-cli WRITES sessions without
    moving where KiroCrew READS them, which breaks session resume. Only the agents
    directory follows it today, so this is not yet a supported way to isolate an
    instance — ``build_pod_env()`` deliberately does not set it. Bringing the
    remaining readers through this resolver is the prerequisite.

    Rejects the same unsafe targets as :func:`_valid_override_home` (a
    filesystem/drive root, or a known POSIX system directory) so a malformed

    kiro-cli derives its MCP OAuth artifact directory from the process's real
    ``$HOME`` (``mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir()`` calls :func:`Path.home` by
    default) -- unlike the agent-specs/sessions tree above, there is no
    documented kiro-cli env var that relocates just this one subtree.
    ``KIRO_HOME`` does not help either: it moves agents/prompts/skills/sessions,
    not ``~/.aws``, which sits outside ``~/.kiro`` entirely.

    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` is therefore an override owned by Kiro Crew, consulted by
    :func:`kiro_crew.mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir` and set by
    :func:`kiro_crew.pod.runtime.build_pod_env` to a pod-owned directory. Setting

    mcp_discovery's remote probe) STATS and unlinks grant artifacts -- it does
    NOT by itself repoint kiro-cli's own writes, which follow the CHILD
    process's ``$HOME``. The two must be set together: the ACP spawn path
    remaps a pod-spawned kiro-cli child's ``HOME`` to this same directory (see
    ``acp/client.py`` and ``acp/runtime.py``), so kiro-cli's OWN writes and
    every ``mcp_grant`` reader agree on one location -- the same "one resolver,
    both sides read it" shape :func:`kiro_home` uses for agent specs.

    Honoured ONLY when ``KIROCREW_POD`` is exactly ``"1"``, which is the same
    gate the write side (``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap``) applies. Reads and
    writes must turn on together: an override honoured here but not there would
    repoint grant READS while kiro-cli kept WRITING under the real home,
    recreating precisely the read/write split this resolver exists to close.
    ``build_pod_env`` is the only writer of either variable and sets both, so the
    paired gate costs nothing and removes the asymmetry.
