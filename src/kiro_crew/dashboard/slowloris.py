"""Slowloris mitigation for the aiohttp dashboard / API servers.

aiohttp (3.9 .. 3.x) exposes NO first-class server-side "time to read the
request line + headers" timeout. ``web.RequestHandler`` only offers
``keepalive_timeout`` (idle time *between* requests on a persistent
connection) and header *size* caps (``max_line_size`` / ``max_field_size`` /
``max_headers``) -- none of which bound how long a client may take to *send*
the initial request. A client that opens a connection and dribbles the request
line/headers one byte at a time therefore parks a connection indefinitely: the
request-read loop in ``RequestHandler.start()`` blocks on ``await self._waiter``
with no deadline until a complete message is parsed. Enough such connections
exhaust the accept loop / fd budget -- the classic slowloris DoS (CWE-400).

The only robust in-process fix is a connection-level guard, since a
``@web.middleware`` runs *after* the request line + headers are already parsed
and so cannot see (let alone bound) a slow header read. This module adds that
guard as a thin ``RequestHandler`` subclass that arms a one-shot deadline when
the connection is established and disarms it the instant the first complete
request message has been parsed. Because the clock stops once headers are in,
it never touches response duration -- long-lived streaming responses (SSE,
chunked downloads) are unaffected.

Wiring: ``build_hardened_runner(app)`` returns a ``web.AppRunner`` subclass
that (a) builds our hardened ``Server``/``RequestHandler`` and (b) sets a
bounded ``keepalive_timeout`` so idle persistent connections are also reaped
(defence-in-depth for the between-requests vector that the per-request deadline
does not cover). Neither knob weakens ``client_max_size`` or the bind-address
logic. Deployments exposed beyond loopback should still front the gateway with
a hardened reverse proxy; this guard is the in-process backstop.
