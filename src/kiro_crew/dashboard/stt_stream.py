    first-ever session is not indistinguishable from a hang. Every frame this
    branch produces on failure also carries a machine-readable ``code``.

    The recogniser's own endpointing FINALISES an utterance: when the detector
    reports the speaker stopped, the final is sent and the session listens for the
    next utterance. It does NOT close, because a session spans many utterances here
    exactly as it does on the other two providers, and both clients accumulate
    finals. That is also deliberately not the ``endpoint`` frame, which authorises
    the frontend to auto-submit and stays governed by ``stt.endpointing``.

    Nothing here is metered, but the duration cap still applies: an abandoned
    session accumulates buffered audio and holds one of
    ``_MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`` slots.
