"""Reclaim the dashboard bind port from a *stale* KiroCrew gateway.

Background
----------
The gateway binds its dashboard port once at startup (:func:`_start_site` in
:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.server`). If the port is already taken it retries for
~15s and then exits. That is correct when the port is briefly held during a
graceful handover, but it fails the far more common case: a *previous* gateway
that died uncleanly (the ``os._exit`` force-exit path, a faulthandler
dump-then-exit from :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.loop_watchdog`, or a ``kill -9``)
left a process — itself or an inheriting child — still holding a LISTEN socket
on the port. Waiting cannot help: nothing will ever release it, so every
relaunch dies with "Port N still in use" until the OS or the user intervenes.

Why not just ``SO_REUSEADDR``
-----------------------------
asyncio's ``create_server`` already sets ``SO_REUSEADDR`` on POSIX, and that
flag only clears ``TIME_WAIT`` remnants — it does **not** let a new process
steal a socket another live process is actively ``LISTEN``ing on. The gateway
integration test (``test_start_site_real_bind_retry``) demonstrates exactly
this: a live occupier blocks the bind until it closes. So the only way to
"rebind cleanly" after an unclean exit is to *reclaim* the port by terminating
the stale holder.

Safety
------
Reclaim is deliberately conservative — it terminates a holder **only** when all
of these hold:

* the holder is identifiable via the port->PID lookup (``lsof`` on POSIX,
  ``netstat -ano`` on Windows) — else we cannot know who to signal → fall back
  to the old wait/retry;
* the holder is a *KiroCrew gateway* process — reusing the same structural
  command-line check that gates ``kirocrew stop`` (:func:`_is_kirocrew_process`)
  so we never signal an unrelated process that merely grabbed the port; and
* the holder does **not** answer an HTTP liveness probe — a *responsive*
  gateway is a legitimate owner (e.g. a second gateway on a different
  ``KIROCREW_HOME`` sharing the port) and is never killed.

Complements — does not replace — :class:`kiro_crew.gateway_lock.GatewayLock`,
which enforces the single-*writer* invariant per home (and whose ``flock`` the
kernel auto-releases on death) but says nothing about the *port*.

Every collaborator (listener lookup, identity check, health probe, terminator)
is injectable so the decision logic is unit-testable without real processes,
``lsof``, or process-killing signals — mirroring the testability split used by
:class:`kiro_crew.dashboard.loop_watchdog.LoopStallWatchdog`.
