"""The crew appearance library's HTTP surface: ``/api/appearances/...``.

Crews wear appearance packs from a library the dashboard owns
(:mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.appearances`). It is a SEPARATE library from Crew
Companion's: that app keeps its own packs under its own data directory and its
own ``/api/apps/crew-companion/`` routes, and nothing here touches them. The two
share only the pack format and the store class, so a pack exported from the
Companion gallery imports here unchanged.

Two properties worth reading here rather than inferring:

* **The slot route is the cheap one.** It is what an ``<img src>`` in the crew
  roster hits, once per crew per state change, so it serves ONE slot's bytes
  with an ETag and a private cache window instead of the whole-pack payload
  ``GET /api/appearances/{id}`` returns. It also resolves the fallback chain
  server-side, because a client that had to probe ``working`` then ``loading``
  then ``thinking`` then ``idle`` would spend four requests learning what the
  manifest already says.
* **Every route is owner-gated and every outcome is SEL-audited**, reads
  included. The gate itself audits a DENIAL (``require_owner_dashboard_request``),
  so what each handler adds is the accepted decision — the same shape the nearest
  sibling uses: ``GET /api/agents/{name}/avatar`` is an owner-gated read of
  user-supplied media on this origin and audits its success. An earlier revision
  of this module skipped the reads on the argument that slot traffic would bury
  the log; that was a guess with no measurement behind it, and it left a
  permission decision on user-authored content with no accepted-side record. If
  the volume ever does matter, narrowing it is a separate change with a number
  attached.
