"""Server-side proxy to AWS Aperture's non-console feedback APIs.

Kiro Crew is self-hosted, open-source software: every install runs on its own
arbitrary origin (``localhost:5476``, a self-hosted domain, whatever a user
picks). Aperture's non-console APIs are browser-CORS-gated and allowlist a
finite, known set of origins — a model that assumes one controlled domain, not
an unbounded set of installs. A direct browser->Aperture fetch is therefore
never reliably reachable for this product, regardless of which domain any one
install happens to use.

This module moves the two calls the in-app session-pulse survey needs
(``SessionPulseSurveyCard.tsx``) to the Kiro Crew backend instead: the frontend
calls these same-origin routes, and the backend makes the actual Aperture
request server-to-server, where browser CORS does not apply at all.

Both the Aperture endpoint and the form namespace (category/name/version) are
hardcoded here, never accepted from the request — the client only ever
supplies the answer content. Following the ``kiro_usage_api.py`` sibling's full
acceptance criteria, the two outbound calls also disable redirects
(``allow_redirects=False``) so the body and identity can never be replayed to a
redirected host, and read the response through a byte cap so a hostile or
misconfigured endpoint cannot OOM the gateway.

**Egress consent.** The survey sends survey answers plus a stable per-install
id to a third party (Aperture), so it is not a display feature — it is
telemetry, and it rides the SAME consent gate as the usage beacon
(``beacon.telemetry_permitted``). When that gate says no (``KIROCREW_TELEMETRY_DISABLED``,
an enterprise ``capabilities.telemetry`` policy, ``telemetry.beacon_enabled``
off, CI, a non-default data home, or the first-run privacy disclosure not yet
acknowledged) the survey never reaches Aperture: eligibility fails closed and
submit is refused. This keeps the beacon family the
repo's only default-on egress family (``governance.md``) rather than adding a
second one.

**Identity.** The per-respondent id sent to Aperture is ``beacon.install_id()``
— the codebase's designated anonymous egress identity (a random per-install
uuid, not derived from any owner id or secret). It is stable across every
browser on one install, so a person is not counted once per browser; it is
per-install, so two people sharing one install are counted as one, an accepted
tradeoff for a lightweight session-pulse signal.
