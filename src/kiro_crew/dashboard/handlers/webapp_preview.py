"""Local preview channel for ``kind="webapp"`` artifacts.

A webapp artifact carries ``webapp_metadata.app_dir`` — the local copy of the
app tree that was (or would be) deployed. The dashboard renders the app card's
preview from THIS local copy instead of iframing the remote deployment:
no dependency on the remote site's frame headers, CDN propagation, or network
reachability — and it works for expired / not-yet-deployed apps too, exactly
like html/widget artifacts render from local content.

Two endpoints:

- ``GET /api/artifacts/{slug}/app-preview`` (standard dashboard auth):
  validates the artifact + app_dir and mints a short-lived HMAC path token.
  Returns ``{"base": "/artifact-app/{slug}/{token}/"}``.

- ``GET /artifact-app/{slug}/{token}/{path}`` (auth **bypass** — the token IS
  the auth): serves static files from the app's web root. The sandboxed
  preview iframe loads ``{base}`` (→ index.html) and every relative
  subresource (css/js/img) naturally resolves under the same token prefix,
  so no cookies are needed inside the frame.

Security model (all LLM-influenceable inputs re-validated at serve time):

- ``app_dir`` comes from artifact metadata that agents can write, so it is
  NEVER trusted: the resolved dir must live under the same allow-listed local
  roots the deploy publish path enforces (``_allowed_local_roots``).
- Web root = ``app_dir/public`` when present (deploy-contract layout), else
  ``app_dir`` itself. Serving is confined to the resolved web root: every
  requested file is fully resolved (symlinks followed) and must stay inside
  — traversal (``..``) and symlink escapes both fail closed as 404.
- Path tokens are ``HMAC(secret, slug:webroot:exp)`` with a per-process
  random secret and a short TTL: unauthenticated fetches cannot enumerate
  slugs, and a leaked URL dies with the token. The web root is bound into
  the MAC so a token minted for one tree cannot serve another after a
  metadata swap.
- Responses carry ``Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts`` which
  forces an opaque origin even if the document is opened OUTSIDE the
  sandboxed iframe — the previewed app can never reach dashboard cookies,
  storage, or same-origin APIs. ``frame-ancestors`` keeps third-party
  sites from embedding the preview; it is ``'self'`` plus the ancestors
  ``'self'`` cannot express (see ``origin.frame_ancestors_value``).
- Dotfiles (and thus ``.kirocrew-deploy.json`` style manifests / VCS dirs)
  are never served.
