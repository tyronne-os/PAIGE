"""MCP Apps handlers — the UI→gateway tool-callback relay (SEP-1865).

``POST /api/mcp-apps/call`` lets an embedded MCP App iframe invoke one of its
server's *app-visible* tools. The dashboard is a thin relay: it validates the
request shape, performs a cheap local capability pre-check (the spool record
must exist), and forwards a one-shot ``app-call`` control frame over the
gateway's uid-gated unix socket. ALL authorization decisions — spool-token
re-verification, backend routing, ``_meta.ui.visibility`` enforcement, SEL
auditing — happen gateway-side in :mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.app_call`, so a
bug here cannot grant an app a tool the gateway would refuse.

Body: ``{"spool_id": str, "tool": str, "arguments": {..}}``.
Replies: 200 ``{"result": ...}`` / ``{"error": ...}`` (backend JSON-RPC error),
403 for gateway policy rejections, 404 for unknown/expired spool ids,
503 when gatewayd is unreachable, 504 on timeout.
