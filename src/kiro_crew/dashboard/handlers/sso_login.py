"""WebSocket PTY handler for SSO login — not available in the OSS build (stub).

The original handler spawned an enterprise SSO login command over a PTY with an
RSA-OAEP encrypted input channel. That flow is enterprise-only and is not
available in the OSS distribution. This stub keeps the ``api_sso_login_ws``
symbol (routed in ``dashboard/server.py`` and re-exported from
``dashboard/handlers/__init__``), accepts the WebSocket, reports that the feature
is unavailable, and closes the connection gracefully. No subprocess is spawned.
