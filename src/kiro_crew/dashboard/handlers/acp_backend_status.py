"""``GET /api/acp-backends`` -- per-backend selectability and machine readiness.

One row per backend id in ``acp_backends.ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN``, sorted by
``policy_id``, including ids this build cannot serve: the dashboard's backend
switch lists all of them and must be able to say which is which, so an
unservable backend needs a row rather than silent absence.

Three facts per row, from three owners that must not be conflated:

* ``selectable`` -- build capability AND deployment policy, read from
  ``handlers.core._selectable_acp_backends()``. That helper is already the
  single derivation feeding the PATCH allowlist and ``/api/config/schema``, and
  it already applies the ``agent_backend`` governance scope. Re-deriving it here
  from ``acp_backends.selectable_backend_values()`` would restore exactly the
  drift that a literal list in three places once caused: the wire would accept
  a value this endpoint calls unselectable, or the reverse.
* ``installed`` -- whether the harness is on THIS machine, from
  :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk`, which asks through the spawn's own resolvers.
  Reached through the SDK rather than the ACP layer directly: this handler is
  application code, and ``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`` is what keeps
  that true.
* ``auth`` -- how the harness signs in, projected from its one declaration in
  ``agent_sdk.host_auth``. Installed and signed-in are different questions with
  different remedies, and a panel that only had ``installed`` could show a green
  row for a harness whose every session dies at start on an authentication
  error. Nothing here READS a credential: the declaration is static data, so the
  row says which store holds the entitlement and what to run, and never that a
  particular harness is currently signed in.

Owner-only, and the snapshot is offloaded: the Claude probe shells out to mise
and walks the filesystem, and resolving the governance ceiling loads config, so
neither may run on the event loop.
