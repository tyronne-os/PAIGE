"""Channel-neutral cross-surface mirror linking.

Links a dashboard session to a NON-Slack channel conversation so a completed
turn's reply is mirrored out via the neutral ``MessagingTransport.send_message``
(delivered by the dashboard turn path — see ``chat_runner._deliver_cross_surface_reply``).

Slack keeps its dedicated ``slack-link`` endpoint (rich thread creation + the
streaming mirror); this is the generalized counterpart for proactive-capable
channels such as Telegram, built on ``SessionMap.set/clear_mirror_link``.

Auth posture matches ``slack-link``/``slack-unlink`` with no new surface: both
routes live under the ``/api/chat`` prefix (``mixed_internal_paths`` in
server.py), so they accept the internal secret on loopback and otherwise fall
back to normal dashboard-token + CSRF auth. They must NOT be added to the strict
``internal_paths`` set.
