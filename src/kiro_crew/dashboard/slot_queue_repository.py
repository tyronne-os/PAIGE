    An edit to a queued message can remove a ``[attached_file N] path`` marker;
    the agent then receives text without that path and never gets the file, so
    a list still naming it would make the drained row show a card for an
    attachment that was never delivered. Each list is filtered in place to the
    entries the edit did not remove (order kept; a list left empty is removed),
    and the surviving markers in the text are renumbered to the filtered list's
    positions. The renumbering is what keeps a spaced path lossless: the
    renderer reads ``files[N-1]`` for marker ``N`` and, when the two disagree,
    falls back to a whitespace-bounded capture of the marker text -- which
    would hand back ``/tmp/My`` for ``/tmp/My Report.pdf``.

    "Removed by the edit" means the exact numbered marker was in *previous*
    (the entry's text before this edit) and is not in *content*. An entry the
    previous text never named is out of the edit's reach and is kept as-is: a
    send can carry a list entry with no marker (a caller that stamps
    ``meta.files`` on markerless text; a path the list redacted while the text
    kept it verbatim, so the two spellings differ), and the edit did not take
    that attachment away from the agent -- dropping it would make the drained
    row lose an attachment the user never touched. Returns the content to
    store; it equals *content* whenever nothing was pruned.
