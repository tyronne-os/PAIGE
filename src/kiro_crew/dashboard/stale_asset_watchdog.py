"""Periodic watchdog that detects stale/missing dashboard assets.

When an update prunes kirocrew, the running gateway's install directory is
pruned — the process keeps running but its static assets are gone. The gateway
then serves the fallback page (see ``DASHBOARD_HTML_NOT_FOUND_MARKER`` in
``handlers/core.py``) and rejects freshly minted tokens (signing key mismatch).
External clients can kill and restart the process, but detection can take
minutes and a forced restart may fail on slow cold starts.

This watchdog runs inside the gateway itself and catches the problem at the
source: if the dashboard static bundle is missing, log a CRITICAL warning
and initiate graceful shutdown so a supervisor (systemd, launchd) can
restart a fresh process immediately.

The check is cheap (one Path.is_file() + one Path.is_file() — no I/O beyond
stat()) and runs every 60 seconds by default. It only arms itself if assets
are present at startup — a dev/source install that never built its frontend
won't be killed (the watchdog detects "assets vanished", not "assets never
existed").

The presence check mirrors ``handlers/core.py:index()``'s serve criterion
exactly (``dist/index.html`` is a file — there is no ``dashboard.html``
fallback), so a partial-prune state where an empty
``dist/`` directory node remains cannot mask a genuine vanish.

    Returns ``True`` iff this watchdog is the one that set ``shutdown_event``
    (a confirmed asset vanish). Every other exit — never armed, or
    ``shutdown_event`` set externally by SIGTERM/``systemctl stop`` — returns
    ``False``. The gateway maps ``True`` onto :data:`STALE_ASSET_EXIT_CODE` so
    the process exits non-zero and a restart-on-failure supervisor relaunches
    it, while an operator-initiated stop still exits 0 and stays stopped.

    Only arms if assets are present at startup. A fresh source/dev install
    that never built its frontend will NOT be killed — the watchdog
    specifically detects "assets were here and then vanished" (the update
    scenario), not "assets never existed."

    A failed check is re-confirmed after ``confirm_delay`` seconds before
    shutdown is triggered, so a transient asset gap (e.g. a frontend rebuild
    that deletes and recreates ``static/dist/``) that coincides with a tick
    cannot kill an otherwise-healthy gateway. Presence is re-checked once more
    once in-flight work has drained, covering a rebuild that outlives the
    confirmation but finishes while turns are still draining; on an idle
    gateway there is nothing to drain and that re-check adds no grace. A
    genuine update prune is permanent and fails every check, so it still shuts
    down.

    Once a vanish is confirmed, in-flight backend work is *drained* before the
    shutdown event is set (see ``_drain_in_flight``): the prune only breaks
    static-asset serving, so active ACP turns can finish rather than being
    killed mid-prompt when the supervisor restarts a fresh process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shutdown_event:
        The gateway's global shutdown event. Setting it initiates graceful
        shutdown (same as SIGTERM).
    interval:
        Seconds between checks. Default 60s.
    confirm_delay:
        Seconds to wait before re-checking a failed sample. Default 2s.
    count_in_flight:
        Optional callable returning the number of in-flight backend tasks
        (active provider turns, Slack session turns). When provided, the
        watchdog waits for it to reach zero — bounded by ``drain_timeout`` —
        before triggering shutdown. ``None`` disables draining (shut down
        immediately on vanish).
    drain_timeout:
        Max seconds to wait for in-flight work to finish. Default 120s.
    drain_poll:
        Seconds between in-flight re-counts while draining. Default 2s.
