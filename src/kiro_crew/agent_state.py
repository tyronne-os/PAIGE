"""Sidecar store for KiroCrew's per-agent bookkeeping.

kiro-cli validates ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` with serde ``deny_unknown_fields``
and rejects the *entire* spec on any unknown key, then silently falls back to
the default agent (``--agent <name>`` resolves to default with only a stderr
"no agent with name X found" line). KiroCrew therefore keeps its private
per-agent bookkeeping OUT of the kiro spec and in this sidecar, so every spec
stays schema-valid for kiro-cli.

Two values are tracked per agent, plus fork lineage, all kept in this sidecar
rather than the kiro spec:

- ``model_managed`` (bool): whether an agent's ``model`` should track the
  shipped ``defaults.json`` (so a default bump propagates) or is an explicit
  user pick frozen against future bumps.
- ``cc_model`` (str): a per-agent model for the ``claude_code`` provider (that
  backend can't pick a per-agent model from ``--agent`` the way kiro-cli does).
- ``forked_from`` / ``private_to`` (str): recorded on a template that is one
  crew's private copy of another template (blueprint semantics — editing a
  crew's definition forks a copy instead of mutating the shared file).

State file (``~/.kiro/crew/agent_model_state.json``, honoring ``KIROCREW_HOME``)::

    {
      "kirocrew":           {"model_managed": true},
      "kirocrew-heartbeat": {"cc_model": "auto"}
    }

This is a near-leaf module: it imports only the stdlib plus the leaf
``config.paths`` and ``atomic_write`` helpers, so it never participates in the
``agent`` <-> ``config.loader`` import cycle.
