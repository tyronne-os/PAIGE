"""Streaming voice-activity detection and utterance endpointing.

This decides *when the speaker stopped*, which is a different job from the
recogniser's own silence trimming: it runs on the incoming stream, ahead of any
decode, so a live session can finalise the moment speech ends instead of waiting
for the client to say it is done.

The detector is an adaptive-RMS one rather than a neural VAD, and that is a
deliberate trade. A fixed dBFS threshold cannot work across a laptop's built-in
microphone, a headset and a noisy room; a neural VAD would work but costs a
second model download and another native dependency for a decision that is
already unambiguous in practice. On real 16 kHz speech the separation measured
here is ~36 dB (speech at the 90th percentile of frame energy sits near
-15 dBFS, the noise floor near -51 dBFS), so tracking the floor and requiring a
margin above it is both sufficient and cheap: the whole detector is a handful of
numpy operations per 20 ms frame.

Everything here is pure numpy and synchronous. It holds no I/O and no lock, so a
caller may drive it straight from a socket read.

#: within a few frames when the session happens to open mid-word.
