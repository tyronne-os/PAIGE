"""The pinned FFmpeg decoder, and a digest-verified store for source installs.

A desktop release carries the ``imageio-ffmpeg`` executable inside its own
interpreter, so it never needs this. A source or Toolbox install carries nothing,
and the only decoder it can otherwise reach is a system FFmpeg from a fixed
set of package-manager directories -- which on a distribution that ships no
FFmpeg package (Amazon Linux, RHEL without EPEL) does not exist, leaving batch
voice input permanently broken with a shell command as the only remedy.

**The trust anchor is the digest, not the path.** :mod:`kiro_crew.transcribe`
already pins one upstream executable per platform by size and SHA-256 and
re-verifies it on every open, so fetching *those same bytes* into the data home
and running them through the same check adds a location, not a weaker rule. What
would weaken the model is trusting a directory: a user-writable path is never
enough on its own, which is why the candidate directory list this module sits
beside must not grow an entry for the store.

Two pins per platform, and both are load-bearing:

- the WHEEL (filename, URL, size, SHA-256) is what bounds the network fetch, so a
  hostile mirror or a captive-portal HTML body fails before anything is extracted;
- the EXECUTABLE (:data:`PACKAGED_FFMPEG_ARTIFACTS`) is what bounds the member
  taken out of it, and it is the SAME table the runtime authenticates against, so
  the store cannot install bytes the resolver would then refuse.

Exactly one member is ever extracted, matched by its full archive name, and it is
written through a descriptor this process opened -- never ``ZipFile.extract``,
whose member name is attacker-controlled path data.
