"""The work-ledger MCP server — the narrow write path from a worker back to the
conductor that dispatched it, and the conductor's structured read of its own fleet.

A conductor session dispatches work to child sessions and otherwise learns what
happened by reading their transcripts. These four tools replace that inference
with a record: a worker writes a schema-bounded status against the ONE work item
it was bound to, and the conductor reads that record as data.

Why this is a store and not a message. ``session_send`` would let a worker push a
line into the conductor's session, and it is withheld from workers for a reason
that does not weaken with care: the text becomes the conductor's next prompt,
executed under the conductor's grants. So the requirement here is not "a channel
from worker to conductor" but a channel that CANNOT carry an instruction. Nothing
on this server reaches ``enqueue_or_run_prompt``; ``work_report`` writes JSON
fields into a file the conductor reads.

Its own server, and ``opt_in`` rather than always-on. ``kirocrew-core`` is in
every agent's spec, and almost no session is a conductor or a worker — for those
the only reachable answer is ``not_bound`` or ``no_ledger``, so mounting these
schemas everywhere would charge every session context for a refusal. kiro-cli
loads a server only when something references it, so a spec that wants the set
hand-builds the ``mcpServers`` entry and adds ``@kirocrew-work`` to ``tools``.
The refusal itself is kept: it is still what an unbound caller here gets.

**No ``autoApprove`` key, and none may be added.** An autoApproved MCP tool is
approved inside kiro-cli and emits no permission request, so ``hooks.on_tool_call``
— the PreToolUse gate carrying the deny floor, the sensitive-path check and the
governance ceiling — is never reached for it. A store that writes agent-authored
text into a record the user reads is not the place to break that.

All four tools are advertised to every caller and DISPATCH BY RESOLVED IDENTITY at
call time, because a session can be a worker to its parent and a conductor to its
own children:

* a binding file, no ledger directory → the worker pair answers, the conductor
  pair returns ``no_ledger``
* a ledger directory, no binding file → the conductor pair answers, the worker
  pair returns ``not_bound``
* both — a second-level conductor → all four answer
* neither → ``not_bound`` / ``no_ledger``

Splitting the worker half onto a server of its own would express the same rule in
the specs instead and buy nothing: a second-level conductor mounts both halves
anyway, so the split would have to be rejoined for exactly the case the depth cap
exists to permit.

Identity is resolved, never asserted. Every tool routes through
``mcp_core.require_strict_session_key`` — the gateway-injected caller block,
``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``, or the HMAC host-pid sidecar, and explicitly NOT the
lenient resolver's ``/proc`` ancestor walk, under which a subagent resolves to its
PARENT's identity and could report against its parent's item. The key that passed
the gate is the key sent on the wire; re-resolving at the request would check one
identity and act as another. No tool takes a session key, a conductor id, or an
item id from the worker side — the server derives all three from the caller's own
binding.
