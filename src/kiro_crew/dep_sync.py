"""Dependency-only sync for a checkout whose console script cannot be replaced.

Windows holds a mandatory lock on a running executable's image, so pip cannot
rewrite ``Scripts\\kirocrew.exe`` while the gateway is served by the very venv it
is reinstalling into -- the ordinary single-checkout layout. ``pip install -e .``
fails there even when the revision being synced changed nothing about the console
script, because a reinstall rewrites it unconditionally.

An editable install needs no reinstall for a source change: ``src`` is already on
``sys.path``, so merged code is live the moment the merge lands. What a source
change CAN require is a dependency the venv does not have yet, and installing a
dependency never touches the project's own console script. Syncing dependencies
alone is therefore the whole of what pip is needed for.

The step is deliberately shaped as PARITY with the reinstall it stands in for, not
as an improvement on it. Every other platform runs ``fetch -> merge ->
pip install -e .``; this runs ``fetch -> merge -> pip install <the project's
requirements>``. The scope matches too: a plain ``pip install -e .`` resolves
``install_requires`` and nothing else, so this installs exactly that and leaves
extras alone. Anything beyond parity was tried and removed -- inferring which
extras the operator requested (pip records no such thing, so the inference has
unavoidable false negatives) and proving in advance that the merge cannot fail
(which needs a growing set of preconditions and still cannot be complete).

That parity includes one exposure, stated plainly rather than guarded against: the
merge lands first, so a failed dependency install leaves the checkout on a revision
whose dependencies are not satisfied, and the operator has to finish by hand. That
is exactly what happens on every other platform when the reinstall step fails, and
it is the accepted behaviour of this workflow rather than something this substitute
introduces. Raising that bar is worth doing for ALL platforms at once, not for this
one path.

Satisfaction is left to pip rather than computed here: every declared requirement
is handed to ``pip install`` verbatim, which no-ops the ones already satisfied and
evaluates specifiers and environment markers with the same code
``pip install -e .`` would have run. Deciding it locally would need a PEP 508
parser this package does not depend on (``packaging`` is not an install
requirement) and would drift from pip's own answer.

Two things a dependency-only install cannot deliver that a reinstall does, so both
are checked rather than left silent: the ``requires-python`` gate pip applies when
it builds the project, and a rewrite of the console script when the incoming
revision repoints it.

WHERE THIS LIVES, AND WHAT IT MAY IMPORT
----------------------------------------
This module is core rather than app-local because the reinstall it stands in for
is not a Dev Fleet idea: the same ``pip install -e .`` into the venv serving the
running gateway is spelled out by the dashboard update handler, the Slack
gateway's auto-update, ``kirocrew update``, and the console-script bootstrap. Four
of those five callers are core, so a Dev Fleet home would mean core importing from
a builtin app.

It imports the standard library ONLY, and that is an invariant a caller depends on
rather than a stylistic preference. ``kiro_crew._bootstrap`` reaches for this
module precisely when a declared dependency is missing from the venv -- that is the
condition it exists to heal -- so a third-party import here would fail in exactly
the case the module is needed. That is also the concrete argument against deciding
requirement satisfaction with ``packaging.SpecifierSet``: it is the better parser,
and adopting it would break the one caller that cannot assume its own
dependencies are installed. ``tomllib`` is imported through a guarded ``tomli``
fallback for 3.10 for the same reason -- a missing fallback degrades this module,
it never breaks the import.

The corollary for callers: import this module BEFORE the step that moves the
working tree. Every caller merges or resets first, so an import deferred until
after that point parses the file the incoming revision shipped -- and a revision
that raises the ``requires-python`` floor and uses newer syntax anywhere would
then die with a ``SyntaxError`` instead of reaching the floor refusal written for
exactly that case. An already-imported module is served from
``sys.modules`` and cannot be re-parsed, which is what makes the refusal
reachable.

    Windows holds a mandatory lock on a running executable's image, so when the

    ordinary single-checkout setup -- pip cannot replace ``Scripts\\kirocrew.exe``,
    and the reinstall can never succeed.

    That matters well beyond one failed step. pip's uninstall is not atomic: by the
    time it reaches the locked script it has already renamed the dist-info aside
    and deleted the editable ``.pth`` that puts ``src`` on ``sys.path``, and it
    rolls back neither. The venv is left unable to import the package at all, which
    also kills the console script the gateway is restarted through. The running
    process survives on already-imported modules, so the damage stays invisible
    until the next restart fails.

    Probing with an ``r+b`` open is non-destructive and discriminates correctly: a

    opens fine. It does not model every way a delete can fail -- an opener that

    Without isolation it does, by two routes: ``python -c`` puts the child's
    CWD at ``sys.path[0]``, so a caller running from a checkout's ``src/``
    (the Dev Fleet backend does) makes ``find_spec`` resolve this package from
    that directory for ANY target interpreter; and the child inherits
    ``PYTHONPATH``, which shadows site-packages the same way.

    ``-I`` closes both routes at once -- no CWD entry on ``sys.path``, no
    ``PYTHONPATH``, no user-site -- while still honoring the venv's own
    site-packages, where an editable install's ``.pth`` lives. Because ``-I``
    implies ``-E``, an encoding request must ride the argv rather than the
    environment: ``-X utf8`` pins the child's stdout to UTF-8 (matching the
    decode below) where a ``PYTHONIOENCODING`` entry would be ignored,
    keeping a non-ASCII checkout path from mangling -- or crashing -- the
    answer on a non-UTF-8 locale. ``cwd`` is pinned to the interpreter's own
    directory as well: under ``-I`` the working directory is never on
    ``sys.path``, whatever it contains, so the pin exists to keep the child's
    working directory valid even when the caller's has been deleted. The
    interpreter path is absolutized first (without resolving symlinks, which
    would erase a venv's identity), because a relative path -- which
    ``shutil.which`` can return for a relative ``PATH`` entry -- would
    otherwise be re-resolved against the changed cwd and spawn nothing.

    ``code`` MUST be a fixed literal owned by the caller: this helper is the
    spawn-audit allowlist's designated isolated-probe entry point, and its
    "fixed argv" justification stops holding the moment caller-derived text
    reaches the child. ``timeout`` is forwarded to :func:`subprocess.run`

    metadata only proxies for this answer -- a working PEP 660 editable install can

    ordinary single-checkout layout this step exists to serve. The import path is
    what the installed dependencies will be imported alongside, so it is the thing
    worth checking.

    Runs through :func:`_probe_interpreter`, so the answer describes the venv

    calling process's CWD (or a ``PYTHONPATH`` entry) ahead of the venv's
    site-packages, and the consumer then refuses a perfectly healthy venv as
    "serving a different checkout".

    resolved this path by a filesystem check, and a venv deleted between that check
    and this probe would otherwise raise ``OSError`` out of a request handler. The
