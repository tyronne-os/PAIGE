"""Remediation guidance attached to a denied tool call — the "do this instead" half.

A refusal that states only WHY leaves the model to invent a way forward, and for
credential work the invention is systematically wrong in a way that costs the
user the capability entirely: the agent re-tries the same shape under a
different reader (``cat`` → ``head`` → ``python open``), each of which the same
rule family blocks, and then reports that the host has no AWS access at all.
The sanctioned path was available the whole time — nothing ever told it.

Guidance is keyed by the CLASS of thing the gate refused, and the class is
resolved by asking WHICH PRODUCER refused, because they do not all know the same
things:

* A producer that names a catalog rule — the regex tier, the argv-structural
  self-protection floor, the git-publish floor — yields the class from that
  rule's identity: :data:`_RULE_CLASSES`, else its category via
  :data:`_CATEGORY_CLASSES`. Identity is authoritative and nothing else is
  consulted for such a refusal, INCLUDING when the rule has no guidance to offer:
  a rule's silence is an answer, and letting it fall through would hand a
  destructive-instance refusal the enterprise-SSO prose its command's
  ``--profile sso`` happens to match. Reading the class out of the rule's REGEX
  SOURCE instead is accidental, and it mis-keys the ten ``credential-exfil`` rules
  that block moving AWS credentials OUT: their patterns name the credential
  environment variables, so they draw credential-READ prose telling the caller
  that AWS CLI calls are not blocked and to run the command it wanted. That is
  fail-wrong, which this module holds to be worse than silence.
* A producer that refuses GENERICALLY — the un-weakenable fnmatch overlay, whose
  globs carry no rule at all, plus the sensitive-path floor and the
  exfiltration-shape audit, which name no path and no rule — yields the class
  from anchor phrases in the refusal text and, for the sensitive-path floor, from
  the subject. A classifier is the right tool exactly there.

The subject is therefore read only on the second path. It has to be: a command
refused for moving a credential necessarily CONTAINS the credential's name, so a
subject weighed against a rule's own verdict would pull those ten rules straight
back to the credential-read answer by that route alone.

``test_deny_guidance.py`` drives the real producers rather than asserting on
copied strings, so an anchor that drifts fails there instead of silently
degrading to no guidance, and a census over the catalog fails when a rule in a
remediation category resolves to no guidance at all — so a rule added later
cannot ship silently unremediated. The index is built on first use rather than at
import because the rules an EDITION contributes arrive through the
``DeniedRuleProvider`` seam and are not knowable until it is composed.

The remediation prose is static, and none of it is interpolated from the command,
which is what keeps it safe to hand back to a model that may be acting on
injected content: it names the sanctioned path, never a way around the rule. The
one interpolated value anywhere in the module is the server id
:func:`credential_tool_hint` names, which comes from the host's own MCP
configuration rather than from the refused call.

    "no rule spoke at all", which are different answers: the first is final.

    Keyed by BOTH the pattern and the rule id, because a refusal leads with
    whichever one its producer chose: the regex tier and the argv-structural floor
    report the pattern, while the git-publish gated floor reports the ID (its raw
    regex is unreadable in the dashboard's refusal chip). Indexing only patterns
    left that floor's refusals unrecognised and therefore scanned, so
    ``git push origin main # rotate the sso session first`` was answered with live
    enterprise-SSO-credential prose drawn from a word in its own comment.

    Built LAZILY, and that is now the only thing deferred here: the edition's own
    rules are contributed through the ``DeniedRuleProvider`` seam and are not
    knowable until the edition is composed, so an index built at import time would
    permanently omit them and leave exactly the edition's ``credential-exfil``
    rules on the scan — the defect this module exists to remove, for the rules an
    enterprise adds. ``hooks.py`` composes the enforced set the same way. Denials
    are rare, so building on the first refusal costs nothing measurable.

    :func:`kiro_crew.security.edition_denied_rules` already validates that seam
    (blank id or pattern rejected, an id colliding with a built-in rejected) and is
    fail-soft, returning ``[]`` on an ungoverned host — which is a SUCCESS and is
    cached. It re-raises only ``PlatformCompositionError``, and that is deliberately
    not propagated here, for the same reason :func:`resolve_credential_tool_hint`
    swallows it: this path explains a block that already happened and must not turn
    one into a turn error. Guidance carries no enforcement authority, so the worst
    case is less apt prose.

    A raise is NOT cached, so the next denial rebuilds. Caching it would let one
    transient composition fault at the first refusal of a process pin a
    built-ins-only index for that process's lifetime — putting exactly the
    enterprise-added ``credential-exfil`` rules back on the anchor scan, the defect
    this index exists to remove, behind nothing but a debug log.

    Both the catalog and the seam are reached THROUGH the module rather than by
    names bound at import, so a caller (or a test) that swaps the composition is
    honoured rather than shadowed — the same reason
    :func:`resolve_credential_tool_hint` goes through ``platform_context``.

    transfer whose subject carries an AWS-credential anchor, and weighing that
    subject would answer it with credential-read prose.

    "" is a first-class answer, not a failure: most denials (a destructive rm, a
    protected-branch push) are self-explanatory, and inventing guidance for them
    would bury the classes where the agent genuinely cannot infer the next step.
