# Discord Integration

Talk to your agent from Discord DMs and explicitly approved server threads.
The channel connects outbound over Discord's Gateway WebSocket, so it works
behind NAT and firewalls with no webhook, public address, or inbound port.

## How the bot behaves

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **DMs** | Responds to messages from an allow-listed user. No `@mention` needed. |
| **Approved server threads** | Responds when both the sender's user ID and the exact thread ID are allow-listed. Everyone who can view the thread can read replies and tool output. |
| **Allowed server channels** | Opt-in. An allow-listed user's message in an allow-listed channel opens a fresh public thread and the turn runs there, never in the shared channel itself. Off unless you add channel IDs. |
| **Every other server channel** | Ignored, including a channel ID entered in the *thread* allow-list by mistake: Kiro Crew verifies the Discord channel type before running a turn. |
| **Unknown users, threads or channels** | Denied. Security-relevant attempts are audited; unrelated guild chatter is discarded silently. Empty user allow-list denies everything; empty thread and channel allow-lists mean DMs only. |

Discord represents threads as specialized guild channels with their own channel
IDs. Forum posts are threads too. Group DMs are different and are not supported
by Discord's bot API.

## Setup

### 1. Create the app

Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
click **New Application**, and name it.

### 2. Get the bot token and choose intents

On the app's **Bot** page, click **Reset Token** and copy it. Discord shows the
token only once; treat it like a password.

- **DMs only:** leave Presence Intent, Server Members Intent, and Message Content
  Intent **OFF**. DM content is always delivered.
- **Server threads:** enable **Message Content Intent**. Discord requires this
  privileged intent to deliver guild/thread message text. Presence and Server
  Members intents remain unnecessary.

Kiro Crew requests the guild/message-content Gateway intents when either `allowed_thread_ids` or `allowed_channel_ids` is configured, so DM-only installs keep the narrower intent set.

### 3. Install the bot

On **Installation**, enable **Guild Install** and select the **`bot`** and
**`applications.commands`** OAuth scopes.

`applications.commands` is what makes the `/` command menu appear inside a
server. Kiro Crew publishes its command set to Discord at startup, so the menu
is populated for you. The scope is **not** required to use Kiro Crew: every
command is also a `!`-prefixed text command (`!help`), and those are the floor:
they work in a DM and in an approved thread whether or not the slash menu is
installed. If you installed the bot before slash commands existed, re-run the
install URL below to pick the scope up; nothing breaks if you do not.

For DMs only, no guild permissions are required. For server threads, grant:

- **View Channel**
- **Read Message History**
- **Send Messages in Threads**
- **Add Reactions** (mid-turn steer receipts and the phase markers)
- **Create Public Threads** (only if you use `allowed_channel_ids`, which answers
  in a thread opened from your message)

A manual thread-capable install URL is:

```text
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=309237711936
```

`permissions=309237711936` is the bitwise OR of exactly the permissions listed
above: View Channel (`1<<10`), Send Messages in Threads (`1<<38`), Read Message
History (`1<<16`), Add Reactions (`1<<6`), and Create Public Threads (`1<<35`).

This permission set does not grant **Send Messages** in normal server channels.
For a private thread, explicitly add the bot to that thread if Discord does not
already show it as a member.

### 4. Find the user and thread IDs

Enable **Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode**.

- Right-click your own name → **Copy User ID**.
- Right-click the thread → **Copy Channel ID**. Use the thread's own ID, not its
  parent channel ID.

Both values are long numeric snowflakes, for example `284102345871466496`.

### 5. Configure Kiro Crew

In **Settings → Discord**, enable the channel, paste the bot token, add every
user who may run the agent, and optionally add approved server thread IDs.

Or edit the local configuration directly:

```bash
# ~/.kiro/crew/.env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your bot token>
```

```json
// ~/.kiro/crew/config.json
{
  "discord": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowed_user_ids": ["123456789012345678"],
    "allowed_thread_ids": ["234567890123456789"],
    "allowed_channel_ids": ["345678901234567890"],
    "auto_thread": true
  }
}
```

Omit `allowed_thread_ids` and `allowed_channel_ids`, or leave them empty, for
DMs only. `allowed_channel_ids` lets an approved user start a turn from a shared
server channel; the turn itself always runs in a public thread opened from that
message, so `auto_thread` (default `true`) must stay on for those channels to
work at all. `soft_threshold_pct` defaults to `80` and is clamped to 1-100; `reactions_enabled` defaults to `true`, `show_thinking` defaults to `false`, and `session_folder` defaults to empty. The bot token belongs in the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` credential (env / `.env` / credential store), not in `config.json`, which an agent can read. A `discord.bot_token` value is still honoured as a legacy fallback, but the credential takes precedence and is the supported place for it.

### 6. Restart the gateway

```bash
kirocrew restart
```

Discord settings and Gateway intents are read at startup. The Settings page
shows **Connected** once Discord accepts the IDENTIFY handshake and sends READY.
If Discord closes with code 4014, enable Message Content Intent in the Developer
Portal or clear the thread allow-list and restart in DM-only mode.

### 7. Test both paths

- **DM:** click the bot's name → **Message**, then send `!help`.
- **Thread:** open an approved thread and send `!help`. No `@mention` is needed.
- **Negative check:** send `!help` in an unapproved parent channel; the bot must remain silent.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Enabled, but no Discord activity | Token missing or gateway not restarted | Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, then `kirocrew restart` |
| Gateway closes with 4004 | Bad or reset token | Reset the token, update `.env`, restart |
| Gateway closes with 4014 after adding a thread | Message Content Intent is disabled | Enable it on the Bot page, then restart |
| DMs are ignored | User ID is missing/wrong | Add the numeric user ID; inspect `kirocrew security events` |
| Thread is ignored but DMs work | Thread ID missing/wrong, bot cannot view it, or Message Content Intent is off | Copy the thread's Channel ID, check permissions/membership, enable the intent, restart |
| Parent channel is ignored | The channel is not in `allowed_channel_ids` | Use an approved thread, or add the parent channel ID to `allowed_channel_ids` to open public turn threads |
| Bot can read but cannot reply in a thread | Missing guild permission or private-thread membership | Grant View Channel, Read Message History, Send Messages in Threads; add the bot to private threads |
| Logs are silent on successful connection | `agent.log_level` is `WARNING` | Trust the Connected badge or lower the log level |

## Access control

- **Two allow-lists for threads.** A server-thread turn runs only when both the
  sender and exact thread are approved. An empty user list denies all traffic;
  an empty thread list preserves DM-only behavior.
- **Channel-type verification.** Kiro Crew resolves an approved guild channel
  through Discord and accepts only announcement, public, or private thread
  types. Accidentally entering a normal channel ID does not enable it.
- **Global intent scope.** Enabling any server thread or allowed parent channel turns on Discord's global Message Content intent. Discord then delivers content from every server channel the bot can see; Kiro Crew immediately discards traffic outside approved threads and parent channels and does not audit routine background chatter.
- **Shared output warning.** Every member who can view an approved thread can
  read agent replies, tool output, and interactive approvals. Approve only
  threads whose membership and history are appropriate for that disclosure. An
  allowed *channel* is wider still: anyone who can see the channel can open the
  public thread a turn runs in, so only add a channel whose whole membership may
  read what the agent writes. Each thread the bot opens that way is recorded in
  the audit log.
- **Slash commands answer privately.** A `/` command reply is ephemeral, so only
  the person who ran it sees it, which is what keeps a refusal or a status line
  out of a shared thread.
- **No credential-minting or approval-granting command.** Discord's command set
  is deliberately narrower than Slack's: nothing here mints a dashboard login
  link or changes the gateway's auto-approve grant. Those act on the OPERATOR's
  authority rather than the caller's, and the machine running the gateway (or the
  dashboard itself) is where they belong -- an allow-listed chat participant is
  authorized to drive the agent, which is a different claim.
- **Conversation scope.** Approved participants in one thread share that
  thread's agent session and context. DMs remain isolated per user.
- **Token handling.** The token lives in `~/.kiro/crew/.env` (mode 0600), is
  masked in Settings, excluded from agent subprocess environments, and can be
  changed only from the machine running the gateway.

## Usage

Send a DM or message an approved thread. Replies stream in place and long answers split across messages.

Discord ingests incoming attachments and can upload local image references from completed replies. Outbound uploads are limited to 10 files, 10 MiB per file, and 25 MiB total per reply.

Every listed command accepts both `!` and `/` prefixes; the `/` form is Discord's own command menu,
which autocompletes as you type and answers **only to you**, so nobody else in a
shared thread sees the reply. The `!` form is plain message text and always
works, including before the `applications.commands` scope is installed.

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `!new` / `!start` | Start a fresh conversation (shared for the current thread) |
| `!compact` | Compress the current conversation context |
| `!model` / `!models` | Pick the model from a button list of what your account can use |
| `!status` | Show runtime stats, the active agent, and whether auto-approve is on |
| `!sessions` / `!session` | In a DM, pick a recent dashboard or same-DM session and continue it here (owner only) |
| `!link` / `!unlink` | Resume or stop mirroring dashboard replies here (on by default) |
| `!stop` / `!cancel` | Stop the current reply and clear its queue |
| `!help` | Show commands |

`!queue <msg>` and `!steer <msg>` control a reply that is already running. They
are message prefixes rather than commands, so they are deliberately absent from
the `/` menu: a menu tap sends the bare word, which has no message to act on.

### Continuing a Discord conversation from the dashboard

A Discord conversation is its own mirror: every turn of that session is
delivered back to the Discord channel it is read in, including the turns you
later take from the session's dashboard tab. Nothing to switch on — the binding
is (re-)asserted on each message you send, so it also survives a gateway
restart or a rival claim that took it away.

`!unlink` turns it off, and the refusal is remembered: without that, "off" would
last exactly until your next message, since a conversation with no binding is
indistinguishable from one that was never linked. `!link` re-enables it. Neither
touches a binding you set explicitly from the dashboard to some other target.

### Continuing an earlier session from Discord

In a DM, `!sessions` lists your 10 most recent dashboard conversations plus earlier
generations of this same Discord DM. It never exposes native sessions belonging to
another Discord user, agent, shared thread, or messaging channel. Tap one and that
session continues in this Discord conversation: the last five messages are replayed
for context, and everything you send afterwards goes to that session instead of your
own Discord conversation. `!unlink` releases it and returns you to your Discord
conversation; `!new` releases it and starts a fresh Discord conversation. `!new`
persists the new generation before replying, so a gateway restart cannot return the
next message to the old conversation. The first real turn adds it to `!sessions`.

While a session is resumed, `!compact` compresses **that** session's context and
`!stop` cancels **its** running turn. Replies from the dashboard for a resumed
session also appear in Discord, so you can hand work back and forth.

`!session` (singular) is accepted as a typo-safe alias, including with a trailing
phrase — without it the message reaches the agent as ordinary chat text, which
reads as "the feature isn't installed" rather than "you typed it wrong".

#### Seeing and releasing it from the dashboard

A resumed session is **two-way**: what you type in the dashboard is also
delivered to Discord, and Discord messages arrive in that session. Because that
is otherwise invisible from the dashboard side, the resumed session shows a chip
in its chat header — `Driven from Discord DM` — with a **Release** action, and its
session menu lists `Connected: Discord DM` with a **Two-way** badge.

Release is the dashboard-side equivalent of `!unlink`, which used to be the only
way out of a resumed session. It confirms first, and re-attaching is done with
`!sessions` from the channel. A one-way `!link` mirror is labelled **Mirror** and
offers **Stop mirroring** instead, so the two are not confused.

The binding is stored per session and survives a gateway restart. A session can
only be active in one place at a time — if it is already attached to Slack or
another channel, Kiro Crew refuses and tells you where it lives, rather than
moving it silently.

`!sessions` is **owner-only and requires exactly one entry in
`discord.allowed_user_ids`**. Session listing and resume can reach any dashboard
conversation plus this DM's native generations, so with two
or more allowed users Kiro Crew cannot tell which one owns the workspace and
refuses the command instead of guessing. Incognito and temporary sessions are
never listed, and session titles plus replayed messages are scrubbed of
credentials and suspicious URLs before they reach Discord.

While a reply is running, prefix a message with `!steer` to fold it into the
running turn or `!queue` to answer it afterward. `[OPTIONS:]` choices render as
buttons, and interactive tool approvals render as Approve/Deny buttons.
