"""Resuming a persisted session inside a channel conversation, channel-neutrally.

A user picks one of their resumable chats from a channel and continues it there. Two
channels grew this independently -- Discord first, and Teams would have been a second
copy of ~600 lines -- so this module is the half that is genuinely shared, split on
the same line ``queue_receipt.py`` uses:

* **HERE** -- the choice list (which sessions are eligible, and the search that ranks
  them), the picker registry with its nonce/TTL/owner scoping, the binding-conflict
  rules, and the inbound routing + settlement state machine. These are decisions, and
  every one of them is a place where a mistake routes somebody's transcript into
  someone else's chat.
* **NOT here** -- posting the widget and the wording around it. A channel supplies a
  :class:`ResumeSurface`, so nothing below ever sees a Discord component array or an
  Adaptive Card, and no address type appears in this module at all.

The routing machine is the subtle part and the reason a second copy was not an option.
Between reading the durable expectation and reading the live session map, a binding can
appear, vanish or move; every ``await`` afterwards can invalidate what was just decided.
So one call returns ONE :class:`RoutingDecision` -- where the message runs, or the
refusal that stops it running, plus the settlement owed once that refusal is delivered.
Splitting it into two resolver calls lets the binding change in the gap and the routing
check fall through to the conversation's own session, which is a silent mis-route.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse).
