"""Durable conversation-keyed shadow of a channel's resume bindings.

Channel-neutral: the store is keyed by whatever address its channel calls a
conversation (a Discord channel id, a Teams conversation id) and each channel gets
its OWN file, because those id spaces are unrelated and one row must never be read
as the other's. That is the only per-channel thing here -- the durability contract,
the version CAS and the retire/adopt semantics are identical, and they are the part
that must not be reimplemented per channel.

All public methods offload filesystem work and serialize mutation with one async lock.
The state and durability contract lives in ``docs/system-specs/modules/messaging.md``.
