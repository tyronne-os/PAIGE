"""Channel-neutral Markdown table rendering for OUTBOUND messages.

A GFM pipe table is unreadable on a channel that renders Markdown but not
tables: the pipes arrive literally and every column wraps, so a three-column
table becomes a wall of ragged text on a phone. This module converts such a
table into something the channel *can* render, and it is deliberately pure and
stdlib-only so it stays usable from every renderer without a dependency.

**It is an OUTBOUND presentation transform, not a rewrite of the turn.** The
canonical assistant text -- what ``TurnDriver.run`` returns, what the session
transcript and the dashboard show -- never passes through here. A renderer
applies it to the bytes it is about to hand its platform client, so the same
turn keeps pipes on the dashboard and gets cards on Discord.

Policies (``TABLE_POLICIES``), all resolved by :func:`resolve_table_policy`:

``off``
    No conversion. The floor, so a channel that never opts in is unchanged.
``cards``
    Every row becomes a mobile-safe card: the first column as a bold heading,
    the remaining headers as labels.
``grid``
    The table becomes an aligned monospace grid inside a fenced code block.
``native``
    The target renders tables itself, so pass through. On a target that does
    NOT (``native_tables=False``) this resolves to ``cards`` -- an unsupported
    ``native`` must never degrade to raw pipes, which is the exact output the
    policy exists to avoid.
``auto``
    Per table: a grid while its DISPLAY width fits
    ``GRID_MAX_DISPLAY_COLUMNS``, cards once it does not. On a target that
    renders tables natively, ``auto`` passes through.

Two properties the callers depend on:

* **Idempotent.** Neither rendering contains a table run of its own (cards
  carry no pipes; a grid lives inside a fence, which is never entered), so
  converting twice is converting once. A streaming renderer can therefore
  convert its buffer eagerly and re-convert what it retains.
* **Conservative.** Anything that is not unambiguously a GFM table is left
  byte-for-byte alone: prose, a malformed table whose separator row does not
  match its header's cell count, a pipe-bearing sentence, an indented code
  line, and anything inside a real fenced code block or CommonMark raw HTML
  block. Whitespace outside a converted run is preserved exactly, because
  re-indenting a caller's text was never asked for.
