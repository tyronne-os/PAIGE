"""Layer 2 -- abstract output events + the ``Renderer`` contract.

The ``TurnDriver`` consumes provider events and emits the channel-neutral
``OutputEvent`` stream defined here. Each transport supplies a ``Renderer``
that maps those abstract events onto its native surface.

``prompt_choice`` is a FIRST-CLASS event (not generic "permission text"):
each Renderer maps it to its native interactive widget. ``[OPTIONS: a | b]``
trailers are the TEXT path: each widget-capable renderer re-parses the
trailer from its own accumulated text and MUST route the parsed list through
:func:`apply_options_cap` before building widgets, so at most
``capabilities.max_buttons`` choices render interactively and the remainder
degrades to a numbered text list the user can answer by typing. The cap is
ENFORCED (see ``test/test_capability_ledger.py``) and pinned per channel by
the cross-channel contract test in ``test/test_options_cap_contract.py`` —
a widget-capable renderer that skips the helper fails that test.
Channels declaring ``max_buttons=0`` render no widget and route the whole
trailer through :func:`render_options_as_text`, which reaches the same helper
with zero widget slots: every choice becomes a numbered line the user answers by
typing, rather than being deleted along with the trailer.

Webex is the widget channel that ALSO always ships the numbered text: it declares
Adaptive Card actions, but the inbound half of a press rides an undocumented
websocket, so the typed form has to stay answerable on its own. It reaches
:func:`apply_options_cap` directly — the widget-channel path, which returns the
kept choices for the card as well as the body — rather than
:func:`render_options_as_text`, which keeps only the body.

    Two sanitisations happen at this sink, both because overflow lands in the
    message BODY while the widget path put the same text in a plain-text
    label:

    * **credentials, in DISPLAY form.** The body is markdown-parsed, so a key

      Enforcing it HERE rather than per renderer is the same argument that put
      the cap in shared code: a channel cannot forget what it does not call.
    * **mention syntax.** Widget labels render as plain text, but the body is

    widget, so the cap lives in shared code and the per-channel contract
    test can pin it.

    Returns ``(body, kept_choices)``: the first ``max_buttons`` choices are kept
    for the widget and the remainder is appended to ``body`` as a numbered text
    list, numbering continued after the widget slots, rather than dropped — so
    the user still learns those choices exist. A list that fits leaves ``body``
    byte-identical; the kept choices are still redacted (see below).

    ``max_buttons <= 0`` needs no branch of its own: :func:`cap_choices` keeps
    nothing and overflows everything, so a button-less channel is the
    all-overflow case and every choice becomes a numbered line through the same
    sanitising sink. Dropping the list there would delete the answers to a
    question the agent just asked and leave the user no way to see what was
    offered.

    **The KEPT choices are redacted, not just the overflow.** A choice label is
    LLM-authored text rendered into a channel, exactly like the overflow list, so

    The ONE parse of that marker. Widget-capable renderers need both halves and
    :func:`render_options_as_text` returns only the body, so both reach the marker
    through here rather than every caller repeating the same steps: search the
    shared trailer regex, ``rstrip`` the body, split the group on ``|``, drop the
    blanks, and decide what to do with an unfinished marker. A parse duplicated per
    channel is a parse that drifts per channel, silently, because each copy looks
    right in isolation.

    Only a COMPLETE, end-anchored marker yields choices, and both halves of that
    matter:

    * A quoted ``[OPTIONS:`` mid-answer cannot swallow the body between it and
      some later ``]`` -- the end-of-buffer anchor is what prevents that.
    * An unfinished ``[OPTIONS`` tail is not a marker yet, so what to do with it
      is the CALLER's question, which is why it is a parameter rather than a
      policy baked in here.

    *hide_partial* is that question, and the channels genuinely answer it
    differently:

    * ``True`` -- a STREAMING surface (Discord, Telegram, Teams, WeCom, and Webex's
      status frame). The text is still arriving, so a partial marker really may be
      a marker mid-flight, and showing reserved protocol as raw text is the cost
      being avoided. Safe there precisely because the frame is transient: the next
      frame, or the sealed answer, re-renders from the full buffer. Held back is
      only a tail that can still BECOME the trailer -- ``[OPTIONS`` as the final
      bytes, or ``[OPTIONS:`` with its content still open. A tail where any other
      byte follows ``[OPTIONS`` is grammar-dead (the trailer opens ``[OPTIONS:``),
      so it is quoted prose and is kept even here: cutting it would be the
      permanent loss described below, wearing a streaming excuse.
    * ``False`` -- a BUFFERED surface that sends once (Slack's extraction, Webex's
      final answer, and this module's own zero-widget path). Such a caller cannot
      tell a live fragment from the assistant's prose, and cutting prose is
      PERMANENT data loss: a reply ending ``see the [OPTIONS section`` must keep
      its last four words.

    The default is ``False`` because the two failure directions are not
    symmetric -- a needless keep flashes reserved markup for one frame, a needless
    cut deletes text nobody can recover -- so a caller that forgets degrades
    toward the cosmetic failure. Every streaming caller states ``True``
    explicitly, which is also what makes the data-loss choice greppable.

    Stripping a genuine steering frame is ``TurnDriver``'s job and happens before

    Parsing is :func:`split_options_trailer`, at its buffered default: this path's

    its own ``wecom.renderer._render_options_as_text``, where the cost is a
    transient flash whose next frame replaces the bubble anyway.

    ``apply_options_cap`` is reached unconditionally rather than behind an
    ``if not choices`` guard, which would NOT be equivalent: a matched-but-EMPTY
    trailer (``[OPTIONS: ]``) must still have the marker stripped. With no match
    ``split_options_trailer`` hands back the text unchanged, and the cap is the

          (``get_or_create`` can raise before the semaphore is held), so
