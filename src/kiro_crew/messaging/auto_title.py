"""Channel-neutral conversation auto-titling.

After the first successful turn a channel conversation has a name only if the
user typed one; otherwise every surface that lists it shows a deterministic
fallback (a truncated first message, or the channel's own label). This module
spends one short background turn asking the model for a name instead, and it is
shared so a second channel inherits the whole shape rather than a second,
subtly-different copy of it.

What the turn is, and is not
----------------------------
* **Tool-free by construction.** Every ``EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST`` is rejected
  and audited (``auto_title.tool_rejected``). A naming turn has no business
  reading a file or running a command, and the prompt is built from
  conversation text the model itself produced — treat it as untrusted.
* **Bounded.** One turn, :data:`TITLE_TURN_TIMEOUT_SECS` seconds, at most
  :data:`TITLE_INPUT_CHARS` characters from each side of the exchange, and the
  result is capped at :data:`TITLE_MAX_CHARS` after redaction.
* **No model id anywhere.** The turn runs on the shared background session via
  ``llm_helpers.background_turn``, so the model is whatever that session was
  created with (``agent.role_models.background``, default ``"auto"``). Never
  pass a concrete model id here — see
  ``docs/system-specs/common/model-selection.md``.
* **Serialized.** :func:`get_lock` gates the shared background session so two
  conversations titling at once do not interleave on it. The lock is taken
  OUTSIDE the session acquire, matching the ordering every other background
  caller uses.

Claiming, and why the LRU lives here
------------------------------------
:func:`try_claim` is check-and-mark in one synchronous step, so two turns racing
to title the same session produce exactly one attempt — including two turns on
two DIFFERENT channels that resolved to the same session key, which is the case a
per-channel LRU could not see. A caller claims BEFORE it fires the task; a SKIP
verdict or a transient failure calls :func:`release_claim` so the next exchange
retries, and a message arriving inside that window is intentionally skipped
rather than double-titling.

A manual rename always wins. Two guards enforce that, because they cover
different windows: the in-process one (:data:`TITLE_KIND_MANUAL` recorded on the
claim) catches a rename that lands while the naming turn is streaming, and the
persisted one — the record must still carry NO title of its own — catches a
rename made before a gateway restart, when the LRU is empty and the claim would
otherwise be taken again.

What a second channel must supply
---------------------------------
This module may not import ``kiro_crew.slack`` or ``kiro_crew.dashboard`` (the
one-way dependency invariant in ``docs/system-specs/modules/messaging.md``), so
the two channel-shaped pieces are parameters:

* ``source`` — the channel name. It labels the background turn's spend
  (``bg:{source}_auto_title``) and the SEL audits, and nothing else.
* ``set_channel_title`` — an optional awaitable given the final title, which
  renames the conversation on the platform itself (Slack's
  ``set_thread_title``). A channel with no renameable conversation omits it and
  still gets the transcript title, which is what the dashboard and history read.
