"""Layer 3 -- shared per-conversation state for DM channels.

Every DM channel (Telegram, WeCom, ...) needs the same basic per-conversation
bookkeeping: a rotating *generation* (advanced by ``/new`` and idle/daily reset)
plus an awaiting-compact flag. This module holds the single shared
implementation so channels do not each carry a divergent copy.

The generation is seeded from the persisted session map on first access (via
the injected ``seed_fn``) so it reflects the highest generation already on disk.
Without seeding, an in-memory counter resets to 0 on gateway restart and a
subsequent ``/new`` advances 0 -> 1, colliding with a stale ``:gen1`` still
persisted on disk and resuming that old session instead of starting fresh.
Seeding to the highest persisted generation makes the first message after a
restart resume the latest conversation, and makes ``/new`` / idle / daily reset
advance past every persisted generation -- always a genuinely fresh session.

Stdlib-only apart from the sibling ``link`` helper; the seeding hook is injected
(rather than importing the session map) to keep this module cycle-free.
