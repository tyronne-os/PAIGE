"""Fence-safe markdown splitting, shared by every messaging channel.

Six splitters grew independently — Telegram carries a
``_split_text``/``_split_markdown`` pair, ``messaging/renderer.py`` chunks blind
fixed-width, and Slack, Webex and Weixin have their own — so a fix landed in one
never reached the others. This module is the single engine they converge on, and
Discord is the first channel on it.

Three properties make it safe for the shared path:

**Prefix stability (the streaming contract).** Splitting is greedy
left-to-right and every cut depends only on the text BEFORE it, so re-splitting
a longer prefix of the same stream reproduces every chunk except the last one
byte-for-byte. A streaming caller can therefore send each sealed chunk as it
appears and keep only the final chunk as a live buffer.

**Real fence grammar, not backtick parity.** Counting ``` occurrences misreads
a ``` line inside a ````diff block as a closer and then inverts the open/closed
state for the rest of the message. Here an opener is up to three spaces of
indent plus a run of at least three backticks or tildes, a closer is a run of
the SAME character at least as long with nothing else on the line, and
everything between them is opaque content.

**Self-contained chunks.** A cut inside a fence seals the chunk with a
synthetic closer and reopens the next chunk with the original opener line —
info string and indent included — so ```` ```python ```` survives the split as
```` ```python ````. The FINAL chunk is left open on purpose: callers own final
presentation, and a streaming caller still holds it as a live buffer.

A hard cut is where those properties meet: it splits one line across a chunk
boundary, so both halves start a rendered line and the cut is pulled back until
neither invents a fence. Some fragments admit no such cut — every candidate
lands immediately before indent or a fence character, as in a bare ``` line or
a long backtick run in prose. Those are not cut at all: the line is placed
WHOLE, in a chunk holding it and nothing else, whenever the LINE ITSELF is no
longer than ``limit``. Eligibility deliberately ignores the fence scaffolding
that chunk needs, so the chunk carries its reopener line and synthetic closer on
top of ``limit`` and may pass it by exactly that much; a chunk with no
scaffolding to carry stays within ``limit``. Counting the scaffolding in instead
would refuse a line that fits ``limit`` on its own and cut it into a fence
delimiter its source never contained, which is the worse of the two costs. Only
a line longer than the full ``limit`` cannot be placed that way, and there the
widest prefix-clean cut is taken, so the deferred remainder can still open or
close a fence the source line does not. That residue belongs to the same
degradation regime as a budget too small to hold a line's fence scaffolding:
forward progress and termination come first.

Which of those three a line takes is decided from the line and ``limit`` alone,
before any of the budget arithmetic — remaining room, the reserved closer, what
the chunk already holds — gets a say. So the dirty cut of the third tier is
reachable only through the ``else`` of ``len(line) <= limit``, whatever that
arithmetic works out to. Eligibility written as a guard along one arithmetic
path is what made this ladder bypassable at budgets a fence's scaffolding
consumes whole, and an exhaustive small-space oracle in the tests pins the
property rather than the instances.

Byte-capped platforms wrap the character splitter with
:func:`split_markdown_bytes`, which measures the produced chunks and shrinks the
character budget until they fit. Still out of scope for callers to wrap: pipe
table conversion, rendered-length budgeting for channels that inflate the
source, and UTF-16 length limits.

    character is three bytes and an emoji four — and a platform that refuses the
    oversize send gives the user nothing at all, so this is the last thing
    between an authored answer and a rejected frame.

    ``errors="ignore"`` on the decode is what drops a trailing partial sequence

    consumes the whole budget all yield ``[text]`` unchanged.

    Cut preference outside a fence follows Discord's long-standing ladder: a
    paragraph break if one sits at least halfway into the budget, else a line
    break if it sits at least a quarter in, else a hard cut filling the budget.
    The thresholds keep a short leading line from stranding most of the budget.
    Inside a fence only line boundaries are used, and a line is hard-cut only
    when it cannot fit a chunk at all.

    Leading whitespace is never stripped — doing so silently re-indents split
    code. Trailing whitespace is trimmed only when sealing outside a fence,
    where it cannot be content.

    the budget rather than not terminating; callers pass a realistic ``limit``.

    span plus offsets is ambiguous for a fence left open -- its last line is
    content, but it sits where a closer would. Deriving it from a second fence

    """The widest cut at or below *room* that invents no fence line on EITHER side.

    A hard cut splits one logical line across a chunk boundary, and BOTH halves
    then start a rendered line the receiver applies the fence grammar to:

    * the prefix ends its own chunk — ``"```abc"`` cut out of ``"```abc`rest"``
      is a valid opener while the whole line is not, and a ``"```"`` cut out of
      longer content closes an open block early, leaving the chunk's own
      synthetic closer to read as a fresh opener;
    * the remainder opens the NEXT chunk — ``"aaaaa```x"`` cut at five emits a
      remainder ``"```x"`` that opens a block the source line never contained
      (its run is mid-line prose), and inside a fence a remainder that is
      nothing but a long enough run closes a block its own line does not.

    So a candidate is accepted only when neither half moves the fence state, and
    the widest such candidate wins. The reference is the state BEFORE the line,
    never the line's own transition: for a line still arriving that transition is
    revocable, so keying the cut on it would move an already-sealed boundary once
    the rest of the line landed.

    The remainder is judged by its FIRST character rather than parsed, and that
    is what keeps prefix stability. A delimiter line must begin with indent or
    the run itself, so any other character rules the remainder out for good,
    whatever arrives after it. Parsing it would instead read text that is still
    growing, where the verdict flips as it grows — ``"```x"`` is an opener until
    a fourth backtick disqualifies it, and ``"``"`` is inert until a third
    backtick completes a run — which would move a cut already sealed one
    character earlier.

    A run of fewer than three backticks or tildes can never be a delimiter, so
    widths 1 and 2 always clear the prefix test, and the fallback therefore lands
    at one or more characters: the caller's forward-progress guarantee survives.
    The caller tells the two answers apart by re-testing the returned width's
    remainder, and reaches for the fallback only for a line too long to place
    whole. *room* is below ``len(frag)``, so the remainder always has a first
    character to test.

    That last rule reads only buffered text on purpose. Checking whether the

    mid-line would then produce a different chunk, breaking the streaming
