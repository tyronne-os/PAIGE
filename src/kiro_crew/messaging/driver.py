"""Layer 2 -- the channel-neutral ``TurnDriver``.

The ``TurnDriver`` consumes a provider's event stream (``AcpEvent``s) and
emits abstract :class:`OutputEvent`s to a per-transport :class:`Renderer`.
It owns the channel-neutral turn concerns -- credential/exfiltration
redaction and the tool-approval decision -- so every channel inherits them
once.

This module stays dependency-neutral: it imports only the ``acp.types``
event constants (a stdlib-only leaf), the ``security`` redactors (also a
leaf), and the ``session_directive`` codec (a third stdlib-only leaf). It
does NOT import ``kiro_crew.slack`` or ``kiro_crew.dashboard``.

This driver is the channel-neutral core shared by every transport;
Slack-specific rendering lives in the Slack ``Renderer``
(``kiro_crew.slack.renderer``).

class TurnDriver:
    """Channel-neutral turn loop: provider events -> abstract output events.

    Parameters
    ----------
    provider:
        An ``LLMProvider`` whose ``stream(message)`` async-yields ``AcpEvent``s
        and which exposes ``approve_tool``/``reject_tool``.
    renderer:
        The per-transport :class:`Renderer` that maps output events to a
        native surface.
    approval_mode:
        One of ``auto`` / ``trust`` / ``trust-reads`` / ``interactive``.
        ``auto``/``trust`` auto-approve; ``interactive`` defers to *decider*.
    decider:
        Optional async callback for the interactive ladder. When omitted,
        interactive mode is deny-by-default.
    auto_approve_tool:
        Optional sync predicate ``(permission_event) -> bool``. When it
        returns True for a permission request, the tool is auto-approved
        immediately (no buttons, no decider wait), mirroring native
        ``handle_message``'s ``auto_approve_subagent_spawn`` hook for
        ``spawn_run``. It receives the EVENT so the check can use canonical,
        non-model-authored identity (``tool_name``/``is_shell``) rather than
        the forgeable title. Injected by the caller so the driver stays
        channel-neutral.
    deny_all_tools:
        Reject EVERY permission request, before any auto-approve path. For a turn
        driven by a sender the channel does not trust as its operator: the
        approval ladder alone cannot express this, because the PreToolUse hook's
        ``auto_approve`` verdict and the Trust/YOLO predicates both approve ahead
        of it. Defaults False, so every existing caller is unchanged.
    auto_approve_session:
        Optional zero-arg predicate ``() -> bool``. When it returns True, every
        permission request in this turn is auto-approved immediately (no
        buttons, no wait). Injected by the caller to honor per-session Trust /
        global YOLO without the driver depending on any channel module.
    directive_consumer:
        Optional async callback ``(kind, args) -> None``. When set, the driver
        decodes session-directive markers from genuine directive-tool results
        (``EVENT_TOOL_RESULT``) and invokes the callback with the validated
        payload, so a stateless session-bound tool (``monitor_start`` /
        ``autonudge_stop`` / ...) takes effect on standalone channel
        transports. Injected by the caller with its own session key bound, so
        the driver stays channel-neutral. When omitted, directive markers are
        ignored exactly as before.
    closing_gate:
        Optional synchronous gate invoked immediately before the provider stream
        starts. Callers use it to reject a lease that shutdown cannot
        drain, and may also reject a structured monitor whose conversation
        generation changed. It must not await: the gate, monitor acceptance, and
        the stream's synchronous turn registration are one event-loop span.
