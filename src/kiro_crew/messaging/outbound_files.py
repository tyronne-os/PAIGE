"""Channel-neutral extraction of local file references from an outbound reply.

An agent that produces an image writes it into the reply as markdown --
``![chart](/tmp/chart.png)``. The dashboard renders that inline, but a chat
channel does not: Discord and Telegram deliver the raw text, so the user reads a
filesystem path where the picture should be. Sending the file natively means
pulling those references OUT of the text and handing the transport a list of
files to upload alongside the remaining prose.

This module owns the part that is identical for every channel: find the local
references, decide which are safe to send, rewrite the text without them, and
report the rest. What it deliberately does NOT own is the upload -- every
transport has its own multipart shape, its own per-file size ceiling and its own
count limit, so the channel keeps that half.

**Extract before splitting.** A reply is chunked to a channel's message-length
limit downstream (:mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.split`). Extraction has to run
first: after splitting, one ``![alt](path)`` can straddle two chunks, and a cut
inside the markup leaves half a link in each -- unrecognisable to any later pass
and visible to the user as broken markdown. Running first also shrinks the text
that has to be split, which can remove a cut entirely.

**A reference inside a code fence is documentation, not a picture to send**, and
which offsets are fenced comes from :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.split.iter_fence_spans`
-- the same state machine the splitter runs, exposed as a whole-text view. Nothing
about the fence grammar is re-derived here, because a second spelling of "which
run length closes which fence character" diverges on the next CommonMark fix.

**Rejections are returned, never swallowed.** Mirrors
:mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.attachments` on the inbound side: silently dropping a
file is the defect, because the user is left reading a reply that references a
picture with no picture and no explanation. Callers surface
:attr:`ExtractResult.rejections`; text whose file was rejected keeps its original
markup, so the path stays visible in the message. Each rejection carries a
machine-readable reason code alongside its default prose, so a channel can
re-word or branch without parsing English.

**The bytes travel, not the path.** :attr:`OutboundFile.data` holds the content
every gate below was applied to, and a transport uploads exactly that. A path
handed onward would be resolved a second time at upload, and anything able to
write that directory in between -- another turn, a subagent, a cron -- could swap
what gets sent for something no gate here ever saw.

**Security floor.** Every reference clears the same gates before it can become an
upload, and each one exists because the reply text is not trustworthy input -- a
prompt-injected agent chooses what it writes:

* a denylist check (:func:`kiro_crew.security.is_sensitive_path`), so
  ``![x](~/.aws/credentials)`` cannot be turned into an upload
* a refusal to follow a symlink, so the bytes come from the inode the written
  path names rather than from wherever a link points
* a descriptor-pinned read (:func:`safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`), so a hardlinked
  inode, a non-regular file, or a final-component swap after the check is refused
  against the inode actually opened -- and the bytes it returns are the ones that
  travel
* a magic-byte allowlist, so only a real raster is sent -- an extension proves
  nothing, and ``.svg`` is scriptable markup rather than a raster
* per-message caps on file count and total bytes, so one reply cannot hand a
  transport a thousand references to the same 25 MiB file. The byte budget is
  handed to the read itself, so an oversize file is refused rather than allocated,
  and an optional per-file ceiling narrows that same read for a channel whose own
  limit sits below the aggregate

The per-channel upload half lands separately, so the core is reviewed and tested
on its own. :mod:`kiro_crew.discord.renderer` is the first consumer: it seals a
segment through :func:`extract_local_refs_off_loop` and uploads the result, and
holds the markup out of its live streaming frames with
:func:`hide_local_refs`.

All filesystem work here is blocking, so async callers MUST use
:func:`extract_local_refs_off_loop`, never :func:`extract_local_refs` directly.
