"""Discord command parsing.

Commands (``!``-prefixed — Discord's client swallows bare ``/`` messages into
its slash-command UI, so text commands use ``!``; ``/``-prefixed forms are
also accepted for muscle-memory parity with Telegram, and the same names are
published as real slash commands):

  !new         — start a fresh session (advances the generation counter)
  !compact     — trigger context compaction
  !model       — pick the model from a button list
  !status      — show runtime stats
  !sessions    — continue a recent dashboard or same-DM session here (owner only)
  !link        — mirror this conversation's dashboard tab back here
  !unlink      — stop mirroring
  !stop        — stop the current reply and clear the queue (alias: !cancel)
  !help        — show available commands

Mid-turn overrides (prefix a message sent WHILE a reply is running; they
override the global ``messaging.queue_mode`` for that one message):
  !queue <msg> — hold this message and answer it after the current turn
  !steer <msg> — fold this message into the running turn right now

``COMMAND_SPEC`` is the single source of truth behind both the ``!help`` card
and the slash-command menu published to Discord, so the two cannot drift apart.

Per-conversation generation + awaiting-compact state lives in the shared
``messaging.conversation.ConversationState`` (re-exported here to mirror the
Telegram module's layout).
