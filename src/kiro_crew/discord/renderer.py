"""Layer 2b -- Discord ``Renderer`` + interactive approval decider.

``DiscordRenderer`` maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by
the base :class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Discord's REST API:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- typing indicator loop (Discord's lasts ~10s per trigger)
  plus the status ladder's first reaction on the user's own message.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- throttled in-place ``edit_message`` streaming, with any
  trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` markup held back from the visible stream.
* ``on_thinking`` -- a ``-# 💭`` subtext note, only when ``discord.show_thinking``
  is on; off (the default) reasoning is never accumulated.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- a transient ``🔧 {tool}…`` footer on live frames.
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- Approve/Deny buttons as a SEPARATE message (so
  streaming edits don't clobber them).
* ``on_compaction`` -- a lightweight "compacting…" note.
* ``on_done`` -- the final edit, splitting long output at the capability's
  char cap, attaching the ``[OPTIONS:]`` button rows to the last chunk, and
  closing with the one-line ``-#`` turn footer (elapsed + context usage).

Progress reactions are the shared ladder from
:mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.status_reactions`, driven through a sink bound to the
user's message: this renderer owns the emoji vocabulary and the REST route,
never the phase machine. ``discord.reactions_enabled`` turns the whole ladder
off.

Discord renders standard Markdown natively, so unlike Telegram there is no
HTML translation pass -- the final seal sends the markdown as-is. Steer
rotation (sealing the pre-steer segment and opening a fresh message headed by
a "↪️ steered" chip) mirrors the Telegram renderer.

Length splitting belongs to :func:`kiro_crew.messaging.split.split_markdown_safe`,
the shared fence-safe splitter. This renderer owns no fence grammar: it consumes
the splitter's streaming contract, which is that every chunk but the last is
sealed (a cut inside a fence carries a synthetic closer and the next chunk
reopens the original opener line) while the final chunk is deliberately left
OPEN. So each sealed chunk is posted verbatim and the final one is retained as
the live buffer, with nothing to append and nothing to undo.

``DiscordApprovalDecider`` is the interactive ladder's awaiter: ``__call__``
registers a Future keyed by ``session:request_id`` and awaits a button press,
denying by default on timeout; the interaction handler resolves it via
``resolve_global``.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed).
