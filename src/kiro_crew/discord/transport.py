"""Layer 1 -- Discord as a concrete :class:`MessagingTransport`.

Wraps the low-level :class:`DiscordClient` (Gateway WebSocket + REST) in the
channel-neutral transport contract, so the Discord channel rides the shared
``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval ladder + SEL audit)
instead of a hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``discord``.

Security: :meth:`authorize` is **deny-by-default**. A Discord bot can be DM'd
by anyone who shares a server with it, so an empty ``allowed_user_ids`` MUST
authorize nobody. Guild traffic additionally requires either an exact thread-ID
allow-list match or an approved channel whose message can be promoted into a
new thread; turns never run directly in a normal guild channel.

        Discord keeps two rosters because it has two audiences, so this dispatches
        on the route rather than testing one id against the wrong set.

        A **thread** route is recognised by its conversation id being in
        ``_allowed_threads``, the same set ``receive`` gates inbound on. Matched on
        the conversation id and NOT on ``thread_id``: a Discord thread's snowflake IS
        its channel id, and the persisted link is built as
        ``ChannelLink("discord", channel_id=...)`` with no thread id at all, so a
        check keyed on ``thread_id`` never fires and every thread would fall to the
        DM arm and be refused for want of a principal. Snowflakes are unique, so a
        DM channel id cannot collide into this set.

        Consulting the thread set keeps outbound exactly as tight as inbound, which
        also settles the auto-created case: those ids are registered in memory only,
        so after a restart such a thread cannot drive a turn either, and
        continuing to post into it would make outbound the more permissive of the two.
        A thread REMOVED from the roster falls through to the DM arm, where a forum
        session key names no principal, so revocation still refuses it.

        A **DM** route is checked against ``_allowed`` via *principal*, and refuses
        when there is none. The conversation id cannot answer that one: a DM link
        persists the channel id returned by ``create_dm_channel``, which is
        unrelated to the user snowflake the roster holds, and re-deriving the
        pairing is a POST a synchronous per-send seam cannot make. So with no
        principal there is nothing left to consult, and an unidentifiable DM
        recipient is exactly the case that must not be waved through: this is a
        network egress boundary, and the caller audits the refusal.

        The one route that reaches that refusal is a ``unified`` DM bucket, whose
        key names no peer by design. Refusing costs an unattended notice there and
        is the correct trade: that bucket deliberately collapses SEVERAL peers into
        one session, so nothing available to this seam establishes which of them the
        link currently points at. Sessions under the default ``per-channel-peer``
        scope carry their peer in the key and are unaffected. Serving it needs a
        ``dm_channel_id -> user_id`` pairing persisted when the DM is opened, which
        is a Discord-owned schema change.
