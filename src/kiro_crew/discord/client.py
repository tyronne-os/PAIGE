"""Discord transport layer — Gateway WebSocket (inbound) + REST (outbound).

Inbound: a persistent Gateway WebSocket connection (identify -> heartbeat ->
dispatch) receives MESSAGE_CREATE and INTERACTION_CREATE events and hands
normalized objects to the on_message / on_interaction handlers. Resume is
supported so a transient drop replays missed events instead of re-identifying.

Outbound (REST v10):
  - send_message: posts a new message (optionally with button components)
  - edit_message: edits an existing message in-place (for streaming)
  - send_message_with_files / edit_message_with_files: the same two verbs with
    attachments, over multipart instead of JSON
  - send_typing: triggers the "typing..." indicator (~10s)
  - add_reaction: emoji reaction (steer-ack receipts)
  - ack_component_interaction: DEFERRED_UPDATE_MESSAGE ack for a button press

Every outbound call runs through one ladder that spends Discord's own
rate-limit accounting (bucket pre-emption, a global hold, an invalid-request
breaker) and reports its outcome as a :class:`DiscordApiResult` so a caller can
tell a permanent refusal from something worth retrying. ``send_message_result``
and ``edit_message_result`` are the classified forms of the two send verbs;
the plain forms answer only "what is the id / did it land".

No external Discord library dependency — pure aiohttp against the public
Gateway + REST API. This keeps the module lightweight, OSS-clean, and easy to
audit (mirrors the Telegram client's design).
