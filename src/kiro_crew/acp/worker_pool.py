"""Reusable bounded worker-pool engine for long-lived agent sessions.

A provider-agnostic pool of warm workers that any KiroCrew app can reuse to run
agent work as **direct, long-lived sessions** instead of per-task ``/api/spawn``
sub-agents (which produce an agent card, a ``:lock:`` approval prompt, a Slack
relay, and a reaper slot). The engine owns only the *pooling* concerns; the
worker implementation (which agent, which backend, sweep protection, working
directory, effort, reset semantics) is supplied by the caller via a factory.

First consumer: Code Review Sage's ``ReviewPool`` (``apps/builtins/
code_review_sage/sage_lib/review_pool.py``). Knowledge Library's ``LLMPool`` and
others can adopt it later without changing the engine — see the design note in
``src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/code_review_sage/``.

Engine guarantees (the semantics any consumer relies on):

  * **Lazy** — workers are created on demand, never eagerly. An unused pool
    spawns nothing.
  * **Bounded concurrency** — at most ``max_workers`` tasks run at once
    (== max live workers); further callers block on a semaphore.
  * **Throttled startup** — at most ``max_starting`` workers cold-start
    simultaneously (process launch + handshake is the expensive part).
  * **Optional clean-slate reset** — before a *reused* worker runs the next
    task its context is reset via ``worker.reset()``. Skipped for a freshly
    created worker (already clean) and when the caller passes ``reset=False``.
  * **Self-healing** — a worker found dead on acquire (or that raised during a
    task) is shut down and replaced; it never re-enters the idle set.

The engine is async; a synchronous caller bridges via
``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` on the owning event loop.

# Sweep-protection shield. Pool workers are direct, long-lived agent sessions
