"""How Kiro Crew reaches KAS: kiro-cli's own ACP relay, not a private spawn.

kiro-cli exposes the KAS (Kiro Agent Server) engine through its ``acp``
subcommand -- ``--agent-engine v3`` selects it. The relay forwards ACP frames to
KAS in both directions, so Kiro Crew speaks ordinary ACP to a kiro-cli process
and never touches KAS's bundle or its Node runtime.

Who answers the engine's credential callback is a per-spawn choice:

- ``--auth-method cli`` makes kiro-cli resolve access tokens from its own
  credential store and consume the engine's ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken``
  request itself. This is the default here, and the whole story for an operator
  who signs in with ``kiro-cli login``.
- With the flag OMITTED, kiro-cli's v3 launcher leaves the wire untouched: the
  same request travels upstream to the ACP client, i.e. to Crew. Crew takes this
  shape when its own vault (:mod:`kiro_crew.auth`, the sign-in that lives in the
  dashboard) holds an identity, and answers from
  :meth:`kiro_crew.auth.provider.KasAuthProvider.get_access_token_callback`. The
  refresh token never leaves Crew; the engine sees an access token and its
  expiry.

Crew does NOT locate kiro-cli's *extracted* KAS bundle itself and run
``node .../acp-server.js --auth=acp-callback``. That works, but it makes Crew
depend on kiro-cli's internal on-disk layout (a
``{data_dir}/kas/{version}-{hash}/node_modules/@kiro/agent/...`` path that
kiro-cli is free to change) and it answers the callback by shelling out to a
hidden ``kiro-cli chat _ get-kas-token`` verb. The relay owns the layout; the
credential is Crew's own or kiro-cli's own, never a shell-out.

Frame parity between the two routes is measured, not assumed:
all forward methods Crew sends (``initialize``, ``session/new`` carrying
``_meta.kiro.customAgents``, ``session/set_mode``, ``session/prompt``,
``session/cancel``, ``session/load``, ``_kiro/session/delete``) behave
identically, and every reverse frame Crew consumes arrives unchanged --
``session/update`` (including the ``_meta.kiro`` display kinds
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_wire` matches on), ``session/request_permission``
round-trips, and the connection-level notifications. The relay additionally
advertises two extension methods the direct route does not, so its surface is a
superset. ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken`` is the one frame whose presence depends
on the auth owner chosen above.

Neither route brings a sandbox of its own, and this is the reason Crew's own
seatbelt must stay on (see ``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`` in
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.types`). KAS implements its own OS sandbox -- seatbelt on
macOS, bubblewrap on Linux -- selected by an ``--sandbox`` argument on its ACP
server, and it wraps each bash command rather than the agent process. kiro-cli's
relay does NOT pass that argument (``spawn_kas_process`` builds exactly
``node --experimental-wasm-modules <acp-server.js> --transport=stdio
--auth=acp-callback``), and KAS's sandbox factory returns its no-op backend for
an absent config. So KAS runs with no OS sandbox of its own either way: the argv
kiro-cli builds is byte-for-byte the argv Crew would build itself. Two
consequences: there is no inner sandbox that could fail to nest inside Crew's
seatbelt, and there is nothing for Crew to delegate isolation TO -- claiming the
delegation would leave KAS unconfined on macOS.

def build_kas_argv(kiro_bin: str, *, host_auth: bool = False) -> list[str]:
    """argv for a KAS stdio session served by kiro-cli's ACP relay.

    ``host_auth=False`` (default) pins ``--auth-method cli``: kiro-cli owns the
    credential and Crew never sees the engine's token callback. This is
    byte-for-byte the argv Crew has always built, so an operator with no Crew
    sign-in gets exactly the previous behavior.

    ``host_auth=True`` omits the flag. kiro-cli then leaves the engine's
    ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken`` request on the wire for Crew to answer from
    :mod:`kiro_crew.auth`. The caller decides this from whether the vault holds
    an identity (see ``AcpRuntime._resolve_spawn_argv``); this function only
    renders the choice.

    No ``--agent``: Crew binds its agent by sending ``_meta.kiro.customAgents``
    on ``session/new`` and then activating it with ``session/set_mode`` (see
    :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_agents`), which the relay forwards. Passing an
    ``--agent`` here would name a kiro-cli mode instead, and the wire-injected
    agent is the one Crew's governance ceiling has actually filtered.

    No ``--model`` either: the model is chosen per session over the wire, so
    pinning one at process start would apply it to every session on this
    process.
