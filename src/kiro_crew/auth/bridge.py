"""KAS integration seam.

Where the auth module meets the embedded KAS engine. KAS consumes auth one of two ways
(see docs/system-specs/modules/kas-auth.md); this module exposes both against a single
``KasAuthProvider``:

- ``handle_get_access_token(...)`` — answers the ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken``
  acp-callback KAS raises when it is driven over ACP.
- ``as_iauthprovider(...)`` — a dict of async callables shaped like KAS's
  ``IAuthProvider`` (getToken / getProfileArn / isAuthenticated / readToken /
  resolveRequestCredential), for the in-process library injection path
  (``KiroAgentOptions.authProvider``).

The acp-callback half is live: :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_host_auth` calls
``handle_get_access_token`` when the KAS relay is spawned with Crew as auth owner.
The library-injection half has no consumer in this tree yet; it is kept real and
tested so an embedded-KAS host later is a call, not a rewrite.
