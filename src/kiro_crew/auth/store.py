"""Token model + encrypted vault store with the External > Builder > Social priority.

KAS credentials live in a DEDICATED :class:`~kiro_crew.secrets.SecretVault`
instance rooted at ``<data_home>/kas`` (store: ``kas/.vault/secrets.enc``,
AES-256-GCM per entry). This is deliberately NOT the user-facing secrets vault
(``config_dir()``): login credentials are auto-refreshed session state managed by
the login/logout UI, not user-provided integration secrets — a separate store
path and key keeps them out of the ``/api/secrets`` panel and keeps the delete
semantics distinct (logout vs disconnect-integration).

Defense in depth: the whole ``kas`` directory is a keystone leaf in
``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` (the agent can neither read nor write it), and
the vault adds encryption at rest on top — a ciphertext-only leak (backup, sync,
accidental read) discloses nothing without ``kas/.vault/.vault_key``. Atomic
writes, cross-process locking, owner-only modes and Windows ACLs are the vault's
concern, not reimplemented here.
