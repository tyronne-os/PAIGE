"""KasLoginService — orchestrates interactive KAS-mode login for the dashboard API.

Ties the token store, install-shape detection, and the device-code login flow into
the small state machine the HTTP handlers expose: status -> begin -> poll -> (token
saved) / logout. The service owns the pending-login table because the device flow is
inherently two requests apart (begin returns the user code, poll observes approval),
and the DeviceAuthorization codes must never leave the gateway process — the browser
only ever sees the verification URI.

Polling is single-shot by design: the dashboard drives the cadence, so a slow or
abandoned login never pins a server-side task. Expiry is enforced locally from the
authorization's own deadline, which also bounds how long an abandoned entry lives.
