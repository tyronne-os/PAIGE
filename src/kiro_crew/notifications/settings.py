"""Per-channel notification settings.

User preferences for each notification channel: mute and priority override.
Stored in ``~/.kiro/crew/notification_settings.json`` as::

    {"channel_settings": {"system.heartbeat": {"muted": true},
                          "oncall-radar.ticket-update": {"priority": "critical"}}}

Semantics (applied at the delivery sink, keeping the bus pure):

- **muted**: the note is still delivered to history (history is a cache and
  the user asked to silence, not to destroy) but is stamped ``silenced: true``
  and its priority forced to ``passive``, so every attention surface (badge
  count, sound, native banner, feed styling) skips it.
- **priority**: user override wins over the producer-requested priority and
  the channel default.
- ``system.approval`` is protected: it cannot be muted and its priority
  cannot be lowered (approval still interrupts while heartbeat can be
  silenced everywhere).
