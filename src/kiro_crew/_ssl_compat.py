"""Make platform trust available before any HTTPS client caches an SSL context.

macOS trust is policy-aware and cannot be represented faithfully as a static
PEM bundle: the Keychain carries user/admin/system trust, explicit distrust,
hostname policy, and validity decisions. Applications must therefore ask
Security.framework to evaluate each connection. Other platforms keep the
file-based bootstrap used for Linux distributions whose Python default points
at the wrong CA location.
