"""The project-scope gate shared by every kind of injected instruction.

Skills and lessons are both instructions that reach a session's prompt, so both
need the same answer to one question: does this entry belong in THIS session?
Keeping the rule here means the two surfaces cannot drift into two different
notions of "in scope" -- a lesson scoped to a repository is admitted under
exactly the conditions a skill scoped to that repository is.

The gate is mechanical rather than prose. A scope guard written into the
instruction text ("ignore this outside repo X") depends on the model choosing to
obey it; this check runs while context is assembled, so an out-of-scope entry is
never rendered into the prompt at all.

def project_scope_satisfied(relpath: str, project_dir: str | Path | None) -> bool:
    """Whether an entry scoped to *relpath* applies to *project_dir*.

    *relpath* is a path fragment that identifies a repository by something it
    contains -- ``src/kiro_crew`` names the Kiro Crew source tree. The entry
    applies when *project_dir* or any ancestor of it holds that fragment, so a
    session working anywhere inside the tree qualifies while a session outside it
    does not.

    The fragment must be DISTINCTIVE to the repository, and that is the author's
    responsibility rather than something this gate can check. A fragment many
    repositories contain identifies many repositories: ``src``, ``test``,
    ``docs``, ``README.md``, ``.gitignore`` and ``.git`` all satisfy this gate in
    an unrelated checkout, and ``.git`` merely does so in every one by
    definition. Refusing particular filenames would not change that -- the set is
    open, and the most likely accident (``src``) is not a special case anyone
    would think to list -- so the rule is stated here instead of pretended at.
    The consequence of a vague fragment is a lesson applying more widely than
    intended, which is what an unscoped lesson already does; it is not a way to
    reach anything a caller could not reach by omitting the scope.

    *project_dir* is the SESSION's active project, the same value the
    ``[PROJECT]`` context block names. The process working directory is
    deliberately not consulted: this runs in the gateway while it assembles
    context, so ``Path.cwd()`` is the gateway's own directory and says nothing
    about the repository the session works on. Answering from it would decide by
    install shape instead of by work -- a gateway started inside a checkout of
    the scoped repo would admit the entry into EVERY session, and a packaged
    install would suppress it for every session.

    Fails CLOSED. No project, a RELATIVE one, an unusable one, a traversal
    fragment, or any filesystem error all suppress the entry, so a surface whose
    project cannot be established never inherits repository-specific
    instructions. A relative project belongs on that list because the only way to
    anchor one is ``Path.cwd()``, and reading that is the very dependence the
    paragraph above rules out -- so it is refused rather than resolved.

    The fragment must name a path BELOW some ancestor, so every form that would
    resolve somewhere else is refused before any filesystem access:

    * ``.`` and ``..`` segments. ``.`` is the dangerous one -- it is a natural way
      to write "this repo", and ``candidate / "."`` exists for every candidate, so
      it would silently turn a scoped entry into a global one. That is fail-OPEN,
      the one direction this gate must never take.
    * Drive-qualified fragments. ``pathlib`` discards the left side when the right
      is absolute, so ``candidate / "C:/x"`` is ``C:/x`` on Windows and the join
      would answer about a path outside the project. A POSIX leading slash needs
      no guard: it is stripped to a relative fragment, so the join stays under the
      project and the only effect is that ``/src`` reads as ``src``.

    A backslash is read as a separator rather than as a filename character, so a
    Windows-style fragment is segmented and screened like any other.

    A fragment naming a credential path (``.ssh/id_rsa``) is refused before any
    filesystem call. Otherwise the walk would ``stat`` that path, and whether the
    entry then appears in the prompt would answer "does this key exist" for a
    surface that may be allowed to save a lesson while being denied file reads.

    The ancestor walk STOPS at the repository root, and an absolute fragment is
    refused rather than reinterpreted as a relative one. Both bound the same
    fail-open: an unbounded walk reaches ``/``, where a fragment that merely names
    a shared system directory -- ``tmp``, ``etc``, or ``/etc/passwd`` reduced to
    ``etc/passwd`` -- exists for EVERY project on the host, so a repository-scoped
    entry would silently apply everywhere. "Inside the repository identified by
    this fragment" is the question, so nothing above that repository can answer it.
