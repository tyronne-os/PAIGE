"""Encrypted vault for agent-inaccessible secret storage.

Storage layout:
    <config_dir>/.vault/secrets.enc   — JSON envelope with per-entry AES-256-GCM ciphertext
    <config_dir>/.vault/.vault_key     — 256-bit key file (mode 0600, O_CREAT|O_EXCL)

Agent isolation:
    The whole ``.vault`` directory is a keystone leaf in _CREW_SECRET_LEAVES
    (security.py), so the verb-independent sensitive-path backstop blocks every
    Kiro Crew-mediated read of these files — tool reads (is_sensitive_path) and
    shell commands (is_sensitive_bash_command), including a scripted
    ``python -c "open('~/.kiro/crew/.vault/...')"``. This is the same
    application-level trust model as ``.local_secret`` and SSH keys; direct
    OS-level UID isolation is out of scope.
