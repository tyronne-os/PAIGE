"""Telegram Bot API transport layer — long-polling + message send/edit.

Inbound: long-polling loop calls getUpdates, dispatches Message and
CallbackQuery objects to the on_message / on_callback handlers.

Outbound:
  - send_message: posts a new message, returns message_id
  - edit_message: edits an existing message in-place (for streaming)
  - send_photo / send_media_group: uploads images by multipart
  - send_typing: sends "typing..." chat action
  - answer_callback: acknowledges an inline-keyboard button press
  - set_message_reaction: one allow-listed emoji reaction

No external Telegram library dependency — pure aiohttp + Bot API REST.
This keeps the module lightweight, OSS-clean, and easy to audit.

#: Mime types ``sendVoice`` accepts. Anything else has to go via ``sendAudio``:
#: sendVoice renders the native push-to-listen bubble but the Bot API requires
#: OGG/Opus, and handing it a WAV produces a 400 rather than a fallback. Piper

        WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated first because the name invites the wrong
        reading: it is **not** a delivery guarantee across a crash. ``getUpdates``
        is Telegram's own acknowledgement — calling it with ``offset=N`` confirms
        everything below N SERVER-SIDE, and there is no API call to un-confirm. So
        once the loop polls again, an in-flight update is gone from Telegram
        whatever this file says, and a crash mid-turn loses that message. Closing
        that would mean either serializing inbound behind turn completion (a long
        turn would then block ``/stop``) or durably storing the update PAYLOAD
        before confirming it, which is a different feature: a persistent inbound
        queue. This cursor bounds DUPLICATE REPLAY, not loss.

        Within that scope, two failure modes have to be avoided at once:

        * Persisting what was OBSERVED replays nothing but re-answers nothing
          either: on restart the process resumes past updates it never handled, so
          any that Telegram had NOT yet confirmed are skipped too.
        * Persisting only what COMPLETED replays forever. An update the gateway
          deliberately never turns into a turn (a sticker, an unauthorized sender)
          has no completion to wait for, so a strict high-water mark on success
          would redeliver it on every restart for the life of the install.

        A low-water mark resolves both, because "resolved" covers refusal as well as
        delivery: advance to the observed cursor when nothing is in flight, and hold
        at the oldest in-flight id otherwise. The replay window is then exactly the
        set of turns that were still running — the smallest honest answer, and a

        that works at all for a local file the Bot API has never seen.

        Scalar params are sent as form fields and non-scalars are JSON-encoded,

        ``attach://`` name a ``media`` descriptor refers to.

        *filenames*, when supplied, is used verbatim in place of
        :func:`upload_filename`. That helper exists to sanitize and re-scan a name
        that came out of LLM-authored reply text; a file this process generated

        and putting it through a raster-oriented extension mapping would rename it
        to something the Bot API then rejects. Omit it for anything whose name the
        model influenced.
