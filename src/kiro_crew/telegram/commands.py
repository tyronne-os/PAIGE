"""Telegram command parsing.

Commands:
  /new         — start a fresh session (advances the generation counter)
  /compact     — trigger context compaction
  /model       — pick the model from an inline-button list
  /agent       — pick the kiro-cli agent from an inline-button list
  /yolo        — auto-approve every tool for a bounded window
  /link        — resume mirroring dashboard replies here (on by default)
  /unlink      — stop mirroring dashboard replies here
  /stop        — stop the current reply and clear the queue (alias: /cancel)
  /status      — runtime stats (uptime, messages, tool decisions, sessions)
  /ping        — liveness check (answers "pong")
  /session     — find and resume a conversation (alias: /sessions)
  /title       — rename this conversation
  /cron        — list / pause / resume / remove scheduled jobs
  /spawn       — run a task in a background subagent (alias: /bg)
  /task        — drive the task runner (run / status / cancel)
  /help        — show available commands
  /kirocrew dashboard [<N>h|<N>m] — send a presigned dashboard login link

Mid-turn overrides (prefix a message sent WHILE a reply is running; they
override the global ``messaging.queue_mode`` for that one message):
  /queue <msg> — hold this message and answer it after the current turn
  /steer <msg> — fold this message into the running turn right now

``COMMAND_SPEC`` is the single source of truth behind both the ``/help`` card
and the Bot API ``/`` menu, so the two cannot drift apart.

Per-conversation generation + awaiting-compact state lives in the shared
``messaging.conversation.ConversationState`` (re-exported here so existing
callers importing it from this module keep working).

    Telegram's own clients (mobile/desktop) append ``@BotUsername`` to a slash
    command in any chat with more than one participant/bot -- e.g.
    ``/new@KiroCrewBot`` instead of bare ``/new``. This is standard,
    documented Bot API client behavior triggered by registering a command
    menu (``set_my_commands``, called at gateway startup), not something this
    codebase's UI controls. Every alias set in this module is defined without
    the suffix, so without any stripping every command silently fell through
    to being sent to the LLM as ordinary chat text in exactly the multi-user
    surface (a Telegram forum-topic supergroup) this integration exists to
    support.

    Telegram delivers a command addressed to another bot in the same group to
    every bot present in it (Bot API convention: a bot ignores what is not
    addressed to it). Stripping any mention unconditionally would let a
    command meant for a DIFFERENT bot -- e.g. ``/yolo@OtherBot on`` -- match
    this bot's own alias set and execute here instead of being ignored. The
    mention is stripped only when it case-insensitively matches
    *bot_username*; any other mention (or no *bot_username*, e.g. before
    ``getMe`` has resolved at startup) is left attached, so the token fails
    every alias match and falls through as an ordinary, unrecognized message
