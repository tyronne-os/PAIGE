"""Layer 1 -- Telegram as a concrete :class:`MessagingTransport`.

Wraps the low-level :class:`TelegramClient` (Bot API long-polling + send/edit)
in the channel-neutral transport contract, so the Telegram channel rides the
shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval ladder + SEL
audit) instead of a hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``telegram``.

Security: :meth:`authorize` is **deny-by-default** and owner-only. A Telegram
bot is globally reachable by @username, so an empty ``allowed_user_ids`` MUST
authorize nobody (fail closed), never everybody.
