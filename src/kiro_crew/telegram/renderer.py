"""Layer 2b -- Telegram ``Renderer`` + interactive approval decider.

``TelegramRenderer`` maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by
the base :class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Telegram's Bot API:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- typing indicator, refreshed for the turn's duration; the
  same tick publishes a stall mark when nothing has moved for a while.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- throttled ``editMessageText`` streaming (typewriter),
  with any trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` markup and any local image markup held back
  from the visible stream.
* ``on_thinking`` -- accumulated and posted once as an expandable blockquote,
  only when ``telegram.show_thinking`` is on.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- a transient ``🔧 {tool}…`` footer.
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- inline Approve/Deny buttons as a SEPARATE message
  (so streaming edits don't clobber them); byte-safe ``callback_data``.
* ``on_compaction`` -- a lightweight "compacting…" note.
* ``on_done`` -- the final edit, splitting long output at the capability's
  char cap, attaching the ``[OPTIONS:]`` inline keyboard to the last chunk, and
  uploading any local image the answer referenced as its own follow-up message.

``TelegramApprovalDecider`` is the interactive ladder's awaiter: ``__call__``
registers a Future keyed by ``session:request_id`` and awaits a button press,
denying by default on timeout; the callback handler resolves it via
``resolve_global``.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed).

    """Render *text* for the no-Rich-Messages path: tables monospace, prose rich.

    Run detection is ``_table_blocks``, shared with table-aware splitting, and is
    deliberately LOOSER than ``_has_table``: a pipe-bearing line above a
    separator row is monospaced whatever the two rows' cell counts are. The two
    predicates answer different questions and must not be unified.
    ``_has_table`` decides a TRANSPORT and so must agree with the server's own
    GFM cell-count rule -- claiming a table the server will not parse is what
    ships a flattened paragraph. This one only decides a RENDERING, and ``<pre>``
    reproduces its input verbatim, so widening it costs nothing and covers the
    malformed markup ``_has_table`` correctly refuses.

    Reached only when ``sendRichMessage`` failed, which -- if this server never
    supports it -- is the PERMANENT path for every table-bearing reply, so it
    has to render at least as well as the plain HTML seal it replaces.

    Wrapping the whole segment in one ``<pre>`` does not: a reply of three
    paragraphs plus one small table would lose every bold, link and inline code
    span and arrive as a monospace block showing literal ``**`` markers -- worse
    than the ragged-pipes-but-formatted output it was meant to improve on. So
    only the table runs are wrapped; surrounding prose keeps the normal HTML
    rendering, and the table at least keeps its columns aligned.

    A segment containing ANY code fence is handed to ``_md_to_telegram_html``
    whole and never split. Splitting means rendering the pieces with separate
    calls, so a cut that lands inside a fence tears the block in half and leaks
    its delimiters -- and deciding reliably where a fence begins and ends means
    reimplementing CommonMark's fence rules (delimiter character, run length,
    indentation, info strings) as a SECOND parser that must agree with the one
    the HTML renderer already uses. Declining to split is the cheap invariant
    that removes the whole failure class: a fenced reply then renders exactly as
    it does on the unmodified path, only without table alignment.
