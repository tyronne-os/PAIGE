"""Layer 2b -- Webex ``Renderer``.

Maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by the base
:class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Webex REST calls.

**The 10-edit budget is the whole design.** Webex caps a message at 10 edits
and returns 400 past that, so a typewriter edit-stream is structurally
impossible, not merely unimplemented. Worse, progress signalling and answer
fidelity are the SAME scarce resource here: Webex has no typing indicator and no
reactions API, so every "I am working" signal is spent from the same 10 edits.
The budget is therefore split once, explicitly: ``_STATUS_EDIT_BUDGET`` frames
of progress and ``_RESERVED_FINAL_EDITS`` held back so the final answer always
has an edit left.

* ``on_turn_start`` -- posts a "🤔 Thinking…" placeholder message.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- buffered, and the buffer's tail rides the next status
  frame so a long agentic turn shows the answer forming rather than a bare tool
  name followed minutes later by everything at once.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- refreshes the status frame (throttled AND budgeted).
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- posts its OWN message with an Approve/Deny Adaptive
  Card AND the typed-1/2 text. Never an edit: the placeholder is mid-turn and its
  budget belongs to the answer, and Webex refuses to edit a message once it
  carries an attachment, so the card could not be retired in place either --
  which is why each card carries a nonce instead.
* ``on_steer_consumed`` -- records the fold so ``on_done`` can mark it.
* ``on_compaction`` -- logged only; the dispatcher surfaces threshold notices as
  separate messages post-turn.
* ``on_done`` -- edits the placeholder into the final answer (one edit), falling
  back to a fresh message if the edit fails; overflow past the message-size cap
  goes out as follow-up messages.

Dependency direction is ``webex -> messaging`` (allowed).
