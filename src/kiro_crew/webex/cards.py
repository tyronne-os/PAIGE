"""Adaptive Card builders — Webex's analogue of Slack's Block Kit.

Webex renders an Adaptive Card sent as a message ``attachments[]`` entry, and a
press comes back as an ``attachmentActions`` activity whose ``inputs`` map merges
the card's collected input values with the pressed action's own ``data``. That
``data`` is therefore the action-id round trip: the same mechanism as a Slack
``action_id``, spelled differently.

Two things shape everything here:

* **A card is an ADDITION, never the only affordance.** Webex requires the
  message to also carry ``text``/``markdown`` as a fallback for clients that
  cannot render cards, and the inbound half rides the undocumented device
  websocket — so a card whose press never arrives must still leave the user a way
  to answer. Every builder below therefore pairs with a text prompt that works on
  its own, and the dispatcher accepts either.
* **A card cannot be retired in place.** Webex refuses to edit a message carrying
  an attachment, so a resolved prompt is answered with a NEW message rather than
  by rewriting the card. The card's own nonce is what stops a stale press being
  honoured after that.

Version 1.3 is the ceiling Webex documents, so nothing here uses a later
feature. Only ONE card is allowed per message.
