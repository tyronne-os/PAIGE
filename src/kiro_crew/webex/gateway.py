"""Webex channel startup -- wired into the gateway boot.

``maybe_start_webex`` is the single guarded entry point. When the channel is
enabled + credentialed it builds the :class:`WebexDispatcher` +
:class:`WebexTransport` + the low-level :class:`WebexClient`, wires the
client's inbound WS events into ``transport.receive`` (authorize + normalize
-> dispatcher), then connects via ``transport.connect()``. Failures are
logged and swallowed so a Webex problem never takes down the gateway.

The turn itself runs on the shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction
+ tool-approval ladder + SEL audit) via the dispatcher -- no hand-rolled loop.
