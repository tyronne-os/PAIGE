"""Webex Messaging client transport layer.

Inbound: Webex has no long-polling API, and webhooks require a public URL.
Instead we register a *device* with the Webex Device Management service
(WDM) to obtain a per-device WebSocket URL, connect, authorize with the
bot token, and receive ``conversation.activity`` events in real time --
the same mechanism the official ``webex-bot`` SDK uses. Activity events
carry raw UUIDs; the public-API message id is the base64 "Hydra" encoding
of ``ciscospark://us/MESSAGE/{uuid}``. The event payload is only a signal:
the actual message (decrypted text, sender, room type) is fetched via the
documented ``GET /v1/messages/{id}`` REST call.

Outbound: plain REST -- ``POST /v1/messages`` to send (roomId or
toPersonEmail), ``PUT /v1/messages/{id}`` to edit (Webex caps a message at
10 edits -- callers must budget), ``DELETE /v1/messages/{id}`` to remove.

No Webex SDK dependency -- pure aiohttp (REST + WebSocket). This keeps the
module lightweight, OSS-clean, and easy to audit.
