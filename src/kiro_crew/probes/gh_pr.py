"""GitHub pull-request probe for the watch kernel (script cron).

Polls one pull request with ``gh`` and stays SILENT while nothing needs a
brain: a pure-watch tick costs no tokens at all. Only an unexpected state
raises a wake, which the gateway delivers into the dashboard session that
armed the cron as a real agent turn -- the woken agent reads its session work
ledger (when available), handles the signal, and goes back to sleep while the
watch keeps running. A terminal state (merged / closed) removes the job.

Everything generic -- state persistence, per-head reset, time-bounded dedupe,
the convergence coalescing window, and the consecutive-failure backstop -- lives in
:mod:`kiro_crew.irq`. This module owns only the two things that are
genuinely GitHub knowledge: how to observe a PR, and what counts as an anomaly.

Wake reasons:

- ``conflict``   -- the PR became CONFLICTING/DIRTY. Classified NMI so it
                    bypasses the coalescing window: a dirty PR dispatches no
                    checks, so ``pending`` never drains and waiting observes
                    nothing at all.
- ``red:<name>`` -- a check landed in a failing bucket that is not in the
                    caller's ``known_reds`` (inherited base breakage).
                    Grace-gated and coalesced: a repository whose checks
                    finish over twenty minutes would otherwise wake the
                    operator once per slow-arriving red on a single head.
- ``ready``      -- zero pending and zero failing after the ``known_reds``
                    filter: review-ready, a human can approve.

Everything else -- checks still running, an unchanged red, a state already
alerted -- is quiet: no delivery, no tokens.

CANCELLED check runs are treated as noise, not failures: on this repository
they are overwhelmingly force-push twins and re-run leftovers, and the woken
agent is the right place to judge the rare real one.

Deliberately NOT watched: the CONTENT of review comments and discussion, and
reviewer-marker freshness. Their ARRIVAL is watched -- a fresh comment or review
is one of the signals that wakes the agent -- but nothing here reads what they
say. The watch detects "something changed and looks wrong"; the woken agent does
the careful reading. A watcher that parsed comment text would need the judgment
this design exists to avoid paying for.

Message format (the probe's configuration, read off ``ctx.message``): JSON
  {"repo": "owner/name", "pr": 123,
   "known_reds": ["Frontend Tests (4)", "..."],   # optional
   "wake_on_green": true,                          # optional, default true
   "coalesce_secs": 240,                              # optional, 0 disables
   "note": "context line echoed into the wake brief"}  # optional

Two drivers observe with this probe and it knows about neither: the babysit
skill's ``pr_watch.py`` script cron (which the user arms per PR, and whose
copy-then-register recipe lives in that skill's SKILL.md), and the auto-nudge
scheduler, which drives it in-process through :func:`kiro_crew.irq.poll` for a
monitor loop whose target it inferred. A probe that knew which driver called it
would have to be told, and the thing it would be told is exactly what neither
driver needs it to know.

    Both spellings are returned because an operator's ``known_reds`` is
    written by hand from what GitHub's UI shows, which is the BARE check name
    (``"Frontend Tests (4)"``), while the identity used for dedupe must be
    workflow-qualified so two workflows sharing a check name never collapse
    into one alert key. Returning only the qualified form is what silently
    breaks every documented allow-list: `workflowName` differs from the check
    name for practically every GitHub Actions check, so no bare entry would
    ever match, every inherited red would wake the operator, and `ready` would
    never fire because the failing list never empties.

    Collapses duplicate rows per check identity before bucketing: a rerun
    leaves BOTH the old row and the new row in the rollup. Key by
    ``(workflowName, name)`` and keep the NEWEST row by ``startedAt`` --
    recency is the correct arbiter in both directions, since a rerun-green
    supersedes a stale red and a rerun-red supersedes a stale green.
    ISO-8601 timestamps order lexically, so a plain string compare picks the
    newer row. When EITHER row has no ``startedAt`` recency cannot arbitrate at
    all, and the more conservative bucket wins instead -- see ``_CONSERVATIVE``.
    A dateless failing row therefore beats a dated passing one, which is the
    point: a row may be undated because it is a just-queued rerun or because it
    is a StatusContext, which carries ``createdAt`` and no start time at all --
    so silence about when it began is never evidence that it is stale.
