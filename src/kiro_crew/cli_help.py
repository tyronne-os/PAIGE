"""Grouped top-level help for the ``kirocrew`` CLI.

argparse lists subcommands as one flat block in registration order, which for
~40 commands reads as a wall the first three commands anybody needs are buried
in. This module owns the taxonomy instead: the ordered sections below are the
single source of truth for what the top-level help shows and in what order, so
``cli.py`` can keep registering a command wherever its arguments live.

``cli.py`` hides argparse's own listing (``help=SUPPRESS`` on the subparsers
action) and renders :func:`render_epilog` instead. Every user-facing command
MUST be registered through :func:`add_command`, which refuses a name that is
not in a section — that is what keeps the listing from silently omitting a new
command. Internal commands (the ``mcp-*`` servers the agent backend spawns)
call ``sub.add_parser`` directly with no ``help``, which keeps them out of both
listings.

gateway vs. service -- the same server, two lifetimes:
  kirocrew gateway          runs in the foreground and stops on Ctrl-C or when
                            the terminal closes. Best for a first look and for
                            development.
  kirocrew service install  registers a systemd unit (Linux, needs sudo) or a
                            launchd agent (macOS) that runs the SAME gateway
                            detached: it survives logout, restarts on crash and
                            starts at boot. Then use `kirocrew service status`,
                            `kirocrew restart`, `kirocrew logs`.
  Run only one of them at a time -- both bind the same port.

Ports: the dashboard is the only port Kiro Crew opens, and it binds loopback
  only -- http://localhost:{_DEFAULT_PORT_TEXT}. Messaging channels (Slack, Discord, ...)
  connect outbound, so nothing else needs to be reachable. Override the port
  with `kirocrew gateway --port N`, KIROCREW_PORT=N, or the `dashboard.url`
  config value; for the service, set KIROCREW_PORT when you run
  `service install` (later, edit /etc/kirocrew/kirocrew.env and restart)."""

    ~17 internal ``mcp-*`` server names — the same noise the listing itself was
    just cleaned of. Validation and dispatch do not read ``choices``: the parser
    tests membership (``__contains__``) and ``_SubParsersAction.__call__``
    resolves through its own ``_name_parser_map``. So membership stays complete
    while iteration is filtered, and ``kirocrew mcp-core`` keeps working.

    ``__len__`` follows ``__iter__`` (the visible count) to keep this a coherent
    view of what it claims to contain; nothing in argparse reads it.

    Iteration follows the help's own section order, so a typo is answered with
    ``gateway, service, doctor, ...`` rather than registration order. A command
    that somehow escaped the section table is still listed, at the end, because
    an error message must never omit a name the parser accepts.
