"""Layer 2b -- iMessage ``Renderer``.

Maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by the base
:class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto bridge sends.

The shape is dictated by one hard constraint: **a sent iMessage cannot be
edited**. Every other channel opens with a placeholder it later rewrites into
the answer; doing that here would leave a permanent "Thinking..." message
stranded above every reply. So the turn's only progress signal is the typing
indicator, refreshed while tools run, and the answer is delivered as one
message (plus continuations when it is long).

Intermediate reasoning and tool activity stay in the gateway: a phone is a
poor place to read a tool log, and each line would be its own undeletable
message.

Dependency direction is ``imessage -> messaging`` (allowed).
