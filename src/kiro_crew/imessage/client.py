"""The ``imsg`` bridge client -- iMessage semantics over the JSON-RPC peer.

Owns everything that is true of iMessage rather than of JSON-RPC: the readiness
probe, the resumable inbound watch, outbound sends, and the two progress
affordances (typing indicator, read receipt).

Three behaviours here exist because the bridge's watch contract demands them,
not as defensive extras:

* **The row cursor is persisted.** Without it a gateway restart silently drops
  every message sent while it was down; with it the watch resubscribes at the
  last row it actually observed.
* **A bounded dedupe window keyed on message GUID.** The overflow cursor is at
  or before the first dropped message, so the bridge documents duplicate replay
  as possible by design. Dedupe is what makes the resume safe, not optional.
* **``watch.overflow`` is terminal and must be answered.** The subscription
  ENDS when its buffer fills; a client that ignores the notification goes
  permanently silent under a burst rather than losing one message.

It also keeps a short-lived **ledger of what it has sent**, because the watch is
an all-chat stream and the bridge's own attribution is not sufficient to
recognise the channel's own traffic in every chat. See
:meth:`IMessageClient.is_own_echo`.

Handles are normalized before comparison so an allowlist entry written as
``+61 400 000 000`` matches the ``+61400000000`` the bridge reports.

        * Telegram advances its ``getUpdates`` offset at fetch time, before
          dispatch, and does not persist it at all.
        * Discord's sequence number is for websocket resume, not delivery.

        Advancing only after the handler returned -- at-least-once -- is the one

        reconnect. That machinery was built here once and every piece of it was a
        defect. The cost of this direction is the honest one: a message arriving
        while the gateway is dying is lost, and the user re-sends.

        Ordering is likewise not this layer's job. Two messages from the same
        handle cannot run two turns concurrently because
        ``sessions.get_or_create`` holds a per-session semaphore for the turn's
