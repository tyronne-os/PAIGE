"""Layer 1 -- iMessage as a concrete ``MessagingTransport``.

Wraps :class:`IMessageClient` (the local ``imsg`` bridge) in the
channel-neutral transport contract, so the iMessage channel rides the shared
``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval ladder + SEL audit)
instead of a hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``imessage -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``imessage``.

Access control here is stricter than on the bot channels, because the identity
on the other end is a phone number rather than a workspace member:

* **Handle allowlist, deny-by-default.** An empty allowlist authorizes nobody.
  There is no org boundary to fall back on -- anyone who knows the user's
  number can send to it.
* **Own messages are ignored**, on two signals rather than one. The watch is an
  all-chat stream and sees the agent's own replies; without this the channel
  answers itself in a loop. The bridge's ``is_from_me`` covers the rows it has
  already attributed to us, and the client's ledger of what it sent covers the
  self-chat case, where the allow-listed handle is the identity the agent sends
  as and that flag is not dependable on its own.
* **DM only, fail closed.** A reply in a group chat would deliver tool output
  to members who are not on the allowlist, the same reasoning that makes every
  channel's non-DM path opt-in. Telegram and Webex can lift theirs because each
  pairs a per-room session with an explicit room allow-list; this bridge has
  neither, so DM-only is the whole gate rather than its default.
* **Unauthorized inbound is dropped with no reply**, so an unknown sender
  learns nothing about what they reached.
