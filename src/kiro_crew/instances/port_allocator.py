"""Local loopback port allocation for SSH ``-L`` tunnels.

Each connected remote instance needs a distinct ``127.0.0.1:<local_port>`` for
its SSH forward. This allocator hands out the first free port at or above a base
(default 7778, see ``kiro_crew.instances.constants``), skipping ports that are
already bound on the loopback interface or reserved by a caller (e.g. ports the
registry has already assigned to other instances).

The "in use" probe binds the port on every loopback address momentarily; a
successful bind on all of them means the port is free. This is advisory — there
is an inherent TOCTOU window between probing and the tunnel actually binding —
so callers should treat a returned port as a best-effort suggestion and handle a
late bind failure by re-allocating.

def _is_addr_free(port: int, host: str) -> bool:
    """Return True if *port* can be bound on *host* (i.e. nothing holds it there).

    Single-address primitive behind :func:`_is_port_free`. The socket family is
    inferred from *host*, so this probes the same address a listener would
    actually bind rather than assuming IPv4.

    Sets ``SO_REUSEADDR`` before probing so this check mirrors what the SSH
    forward listener actually does at bind time — OpenSSH sets ``SO_REUSEADDR``
    on its ``-L`` listener. This matters for the disconnect -> reconnect path:
    when a tunnel is torn down, ``_SshTunnel.stop()`` reaps the ``ssh`` child so
    the *listener* socket is gone, but the forward's **accepted** data
    connections (the embedded dashboard's WebSocket/API traffic) linger in
    ``TIME_WAIT`` on ``127.0.0.1:<port>`` for the OS's 2*MSL window (~30-60s),
    each still bound to that local addr:port. A probe *without* ``SO_REUSEADDR``
    fails to bind while any such ``TIME_WAIT`` socket exists, so the connect
    pre-flight would falsely report the just-freed port as "in use" and reject
    the reconnect — the observed symptom of having to "wait longer" before a
    just-disconnected instance can be reconnected. With ``SO_REUSEADDR`` set the
    probe matches ssh: a ``TIME_WAIT`` remnant is not a false positive,
    while a genuinely *live* listener (a real port collision between two
    connected instances) still fails to bind and is correctly reported in use
    (``SO_REUSEADDR`` exempts ``TIME_WAIT`` only, never an active ``LISTEN``).

    A bind failure (``OSError``) is interpreted as "in use / unavailable", except
    for the errnos in :data:`_ADDRESS_UNUSABLE`, which mean the address itself is
    not assignable on this host and therefore cannot be occupied.

    Socket creation is read against :data:`_FAMILY_UNUSABLE` in the same spirit:
    an absent protocol family cannot hold a listener, so it reads as free. Any
    other creation error PROPAGATES rather than being reported either way — it
    means the probe could not be run, which is neither "free" (that would hand
    out a port a listener may hold) nor "in use" (that would make the allocator
    walk every candidate and fail with a port-exhaustion message naming the wrong
    cause). Letting it out preserves the pre-dual-stack behavior, where a creation
    error was never caught at all.
