"""Tests for the project scanner's traversal and classification.

The walker is the part of the feature a user cannot inspect before trusting it:
it is pointed at an unfamiliar tree and its answer decides which folders get
created. So the tests here pin the four things that make that trustworthy —

1. **Bounded and read-only.** Links are never followed (a POSIX symlink or a
   Windows junction alike), dependency and
   build directories are never entered, the depth cap holds, and the tree on
   disk is byte-for-byte unchanged afterwards.
2. **Prune beats every signal.** A manifest under a pruned directory, or on a
   pruned directory itself, yields no candidate.
3. **Tier rules.** A repository or top-level manifest is auto-selected; a
   manifest nested inside a package is only offered; a directory the user has
   already used with Kiro is auto-selected wherever it sits.
4. **Determinism.** Two scans of an unchanged tree return equal trees, and a
   directory that cannot be read costs a warning rather than the whole scan.

Fixtures are built as literal directory layouts because the bugs this code can
have are layout-shaped; a mocked filesystem would hide exactly the cases
(symlink, permission, iteration order) worth testing.

        and before the walk opens that child.

        The swapped-out directory is moved to ``park`` rather than removed, which
        is what makes the identity check's premise hold on every filesystem. An
        inode number freed by ``rmdir`` is commonly handed straight back to the
        next allocation, so a removed directory and the symlink replacing it can
        share an inode number and be indistinguishable by identity; keeping the
        directory alive guarantees the link is a different inode. ``park`` must
        sit outside the scan root so the moved directory is not itself scanned.

        The link is staged through ``conftest.make_dir_link`` -- a symlink on POSIX,
        a junction on Windows -- so the Windows-shape case below runs on an
        unelevated Windows host instead of dying inside the walker's directory read
        with WinError 1314 (which the walker records as a warning and reports as an
        empty tree, failing the test for the wrong reason). ``realpath`` resolves a
        junction exactly as it resolves a symlink, which is the property under test.
        The swap is armed by ``park``'s existence rather than ``is_symlink()``,
        which is False for a junction.
