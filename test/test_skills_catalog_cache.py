"""Behavioural tests for the ``GET /api/skills`` single-flight join.

Covers:
- concurrent readers coalesce onto ONE assembly (the measured fix: 0% -> 87.5%
  redundant-scan elimination at 8-way)
- NOTHING is retained past the burst, so a later read always rescans and the
  base's recorded "no result cache" default still holds
- a different loader is a different catalog and never joins
- readers of different projects serialize on the one global assembly lock
- no module owes the catalog an invalidation: no invalidator exists to call

Every test stubs the two expensive collaborators (the edition capability manager
and ``collect_skills_blocking``) and counts calls, so "shared one assembly" is
asserted by the assembler NOT running rather than by a latency measurement.
