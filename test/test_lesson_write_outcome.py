"""What a lesson write reports, and the four surfaces that read it.

``write_lesson`` used to return a bare ``bool``, and its ``False`` meant several
unrelated things at once: validation refused the value, a dedup rule claimed the write,
the submit was a no-op, or a bare re-submit deliberately kept a stored NOT-clause. The
first group means "your lesson did not land"; the second means "your lesson is fine,
there was nothing to do". These tests pin the outcome each path now reports, that the
result's TRUTH VALUE still answers the old bool's predicate (so the callers that only
branch on success are unaffected -- see ``TestWriteLessonTruthValueIsTheOldBool``), and
that the three surfaces a human or a model reads -- the CLI, the ``/api/lessons``
response and the ``learn_add`` tool result -- stop saying "Saved" for a write that
stored nothing.

        credential regex does not match -- and the control-strip then REASSEMBLES the
