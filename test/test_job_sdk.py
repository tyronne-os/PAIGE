"""Tests for the Job SDK — app-scoped durable runs.

Covers the runner registry, per-run JSON records, cooperative cancellation via
a threading.Event, the startup reconciliation pass, and the process-wide SDK
registry.

Runs execute on real daemon threads, so terminal state is awaited with a
bounded poll (``_wait_terminal``) rather than a fixed sleep — a fixed sleep is
what makes such a suite flaky on a loaded runner.

    The SDK cannot stop work a runner spawned onto a thread it does not own -- unless

    submits to a pool and returns the unwaited `concurrent.futures.Future`. For one
    instant `_execute` holds the only reference to that work.

    It already ASKED that reference to stop before this change, as hygiene, and threw
    the answer away -- so the record warned about work the next line had guaranteed
    would never run. These tests pin both directions: the record must say a stop
    happened when it did, and must never say one happened when it did not.
