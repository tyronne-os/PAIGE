"""Regression tests for the cron-locking / cron.py audit fixes (cluster C).

Each test encodes the exact failure scenario from the audit so it fails against
the pre-fix code and passes against the remediation:

1. Blocking ``fcntl.flock`` on the event loop in store mutators
   → ``_file_lock`` now uses a bounded non-blocking ``try_acquire_lock`` spin.
2. Unlocked read paths (``list_jobs`` / ``get_job`` / ``run_job`` / reaper)
   racing the off-loop batch-remove worker → the loop-resident write paths
   sync under the lock; the loop-resident READ paths (``list_jobs`` /
   ``get_job``) are cache-only — they perform NO filesystem I/O at all (no
   ``read_bytes``/hash, no lock-file open), so a large store can never freeze
   the loop. Cross-process freshness is maintained off-loop by the timer tick
   and mutators; callers needing a guaranteed-fresh read use the offloaded
   ``list_jobs_async`` / ``get_job_async`` variants.
3. mtime-equality staleness in ``_sync`` losing same-second external writes,
   and (mtime_ns, size) collisions losing equal-length content rewrites
   → ``_sync`` compares a content DIGEST derived from the same bytes it parses.
4. ``_arm_timer`` cancelling the currently-running timer task
   → ``_arm_timer`` never cancels ``asyncio.current_task()``.
5. Skip-date lookahead bound coupled to schedule granularity (silently
   returning ``None`` for schedules finer than the cap was sized for)
   → the advance is bounded by a wall-clock horizon, not an iteration count.

The loop-resident scheduling paths (timer tick, reaper sweep, ``run_job``) never
take the store lock or ``_sync()`` on the event loop: the timer tick and
``run_job`` offload their locked sync + snapshot to a worker thread
(``asyncio.to_thread``) and run only the mutation-free scan/claim on the loop,
while the reaper snapshots the atomically-swapped in-memory job list cache-only.
