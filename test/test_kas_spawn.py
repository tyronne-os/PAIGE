"""KAS spawn contract: relay argv, auth owner, sandbox classification, capabilities, demux.

Kiro Crew reaches KAS through kiro-cli's own ACP relay
(``kiro-cli acp --agent-engine v3``) rather than by locating kiro-cli's
extracted KAS bundle and running ``node acp-server.js`` itself. See
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_transport` for why, for the frame-parity measurement
that preceded the switch, and for the two auth owners: ``--auth-method cli``
(kiro-cli's store, the default) or -- when Crew's own vault holds an identity --
no flag, with Crew answering the engine's ``_kiro/auth/getAccessToken`` request
from :mod:`kiro_crew.auth`.

The invocation proof lives in ``TestKasInvocation``: it spawns a real
``AcpRuntime`` configured for the KAS backend against a stub agent that speaks
KAS's dialect, and completes ``initialize`` -> ``session/new``. That exercises
OUR spawn path, argv, capabilities and demux; it does not exercise the real KAS
build, which is kiro-cli's to ship.

Driving the REAL build is deliberately NOT a test here: a real prompt turn spends
the operator's credits and needs their live credential store, state no
``tmp_path`` contains, and an env-var opt-in is not enough protection when that
variable can be set in a shell profile or a CI matrix and then reached by an
ordinary ``pytest`` run.

When working on the backend, drive it by hand instead -- with the relay this
needs no asset overrides and no token plumbing, because kiro-cli owns both::
