"""The descriptor-pinned staging primitive, and snapshot/restore's use of it.

Written as an A/B suite rather than a list of assertions. The point of this change is
that a pinned traversal is strictly stronger than a by-name one, and the only honest
way to show that is to run the SAME attack against both paths and watch one leak while
the other refuses -- an exception-only assertion cannot tell "pinned" from "got lucky".

The mid-walk swap is performed inside the ``ignore`` callback, which both paths invoke
once per directory with that directory's contents. That is the check-to-use window
made deterministic: the screen has just looked at the entry and declared it fine, and
the copy of that entry has not happened yet.
