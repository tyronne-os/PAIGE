"""Teams proactive routing: learning an address, and forgetting a dead one.

The Bot Framework offers no way to LOOK UP a conversation's ``serviceUrl``, so the
only copy is the one we recorded. Two consequences, one per direction:

* Until something records it, no cron result, mirror leg or ``send_message`` tool
  can reach that person -- so a promptless install/join activity, which carries the
  whole routable tuple under the same JWT attestation as a message, is learned.
* Once a user blocks the bot or removes the app the route is permanently dead, and
  keeping it turns every later send into a red badge with nothing able to clear it.

Both paths re-apply the SAME authorization the message path does, which is what
keeps "reachable" from meaning "authorized".
