"""Tests for the sync-IO-in-async ratchet (scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py).

#3057: nothing in the repository failed when blocking IO was written inside an
``async def``, so the count grew back after every individual fix -- ~70 on-loop
``store.db.execute()`` calls in ``dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py`` against zero
in ``dashboard/handlers/memory.py`` in the same directory. These tests pin the
halves that must stay true together: CI actually runs the gate (a gate that
exists only on disk is not a gate), the AST rules flag what they claim to flag
AND stay quiet on the sanctioned offload idioms, and the baseline can only
shrink -- no operation may add a path or raise a count.
