"""An ACP adapter's OAuth token store is on the sensitive-path floor.

Each adapter owns its own sign-in flow and persists its own tokens. Kiro Crew
never reads them — it only ever checks that the file EXISTS so it can name the
right sign-in command — so an agent ``fs_read`` of one buys nothing legitimate
and would let it impersonate the operator against that vendor.

Claude Code is already selectable, so its leaf being off the floor was a live
read, not a hypothetical. Codex's leaf has the same shape.

Two properties are pinned separately because they fail apart:

* the ``$HOME``-rooted default is classified, and the adapter's sibling CONFIG
  files are NOT (routing diagnosis reads them and they hold no credential); and
* the leaf is re-anchored under every home override the adapter honours, since
  an override moves the token out from under a ``$HOME``-rooted entry.

Each test is revert-verified: with the corresponding half of the change removed
they fail.
