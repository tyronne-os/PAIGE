        Asserted through `is_denied`, the real enforcement path, NOT against `rule.pattern`.
        That distinction is the point: this rule is one of `_SELF_PROTECTION_FLOOR_RULE_IDS`,
        so its regex is a human-auditable statement of intent while the actual matching is a
        UNION of that regex and the argv-structural floor. An earlier version of this test
        searched the pattern directly and would have gone green on a floor that had stopped
        running at all.

        The module form is why the union matters. `python -m kiro_crew token` mints the
        identical token, but its argv PROGRAM is the interpreter and the underscored import
        name is not a console-script spelling — so neither the command-position regex nor
        `_is_self_program` saw it. `_is_self_module_invocation` closes it structurally.

    The 137 built-in rule patterns were authored for kiro-cli's linear-time

    classes on hostile input:

      1. **Exponential** — the 46 ``aws-*`` patterns share a nested-star flag
         run ``(?:\\s+--?[a-z-]+(?:[= ]\\S+)?)*`` that blows up on a short
         ``aws -x -x -x …`` string (~40 flag repeats / ~124 chars already
         hangs), so a length bound alone can NOT save it.
      2. **Polynomial** — the ~50 leading-``.*`` patterns and the multi-``.*``
         chains (e.g. ``python.*open.*/\\.ssh/``) each scan the whole string;
         across all patterns a 20k-char input costs seconds.

    ``security`` mitigates both purely at the evaluation layer, with the rule
    catalog / golden fixture left byte-for-byte unchanged: the exponential aws
    flag-run is rewritten to a linear equivalent, and every pattern is SPLIT on
    its top-level ``.*`` gaps and existence-matched fragment-by-fragment with an
    advancing ``re.search`` (equivalent to the whole regex, but O(n) with no
    backtracking across the gaps).  Because matching is O(n) it runs on the FULL
    untruncated string, so there is NO length bound — a destructive needle at
    any offset, even hidden behind a >2KB prefix inside a SINGLE un-separated

        when every literal (``python``/``boto3``/``get_credentials``) is present, which
        defeats a literal pre-filter.

        Asserted DETERMINISTICALLY, not by timing. A timed doubling ratio cannot separate this
        property from the runner: on a shared CI host, scheduler noise, frequency scaling, and
        co-tenant cache contention inflate even a thread-CPU ratio past any bound tight enough
        to catch a quadratic (measured 3.2x against a 3.0 bound with the property intact), so
        the ratio form false-reds PRs whose diff never touches the matcher. What makes the scan
        linear is structural, so it is asserted structurally, and a regression has to break one
        of these to reintroduce super-linear cost:

          1. ROUTING — the chain rules take the full-input fragment path (never the bounded
             whole-regex fallback, whose truncation cap is pinned separately by
             ``test_documented_bound_applies_only_where_the_bounded_engine_is_needed``), and every fragment they
             split into is a plain literal, so each is one forward ``re.search`` scan with no
             variable-width backtracking;
          2. INVOCATIONS — doubling the adversarial input leaves the engine-invocation trace
             IDENTICAL (same searches, same patterns, same order), so the only thing that grows
             with the input is the length of each single linear scan.

        The small-size absolute CPU budget stays as the catastrophic-blowup backstop for cost
        added outside the matcher, where this trace cannot see it.

class TestSelfProtectionKillTargetScoping:
    """The kill rule matches the kill TARGET, not co-occurrence.

    ``pkill``/``killall`` select processes by name, so the product name as an
    argument to them is the target.  Bare ``kill`` takes PIDs and can only aim
    at the product through a command substitution that resolves the name.

    Scoping is ARGV-STRUCTURAL: the command is tokenized (resolving shell
    quoting) before matching, rather than having its raw text split on
    separators.  ``pkill -f`` takes an extended regex and accepts a path, so
    ``pkill -f 'x|<name>'``, ``pkill -f '[;]*<name>'`` and
    ``pkill -f /usr/local/bin/<name>`` are all real by-name kills that any
    matcher reading those quoted characters as shell syntax would let through.

        A timed doubling ratio cannot separate this property from the runner: on a
        starved shared CI host, scheduler noise, GC pauses, and frequency scaling
        inflate the ratio past any bound tight enough to catch the quadratic (a run
        was observed failing the 3x ratio while the absolute budget below passed
        with 2.1x headroom -- the red measured the runner, not the code), so the
        ratio form false-reds PRs whose diff never touches this scan. The linearity
        is structural, so it is asserted structurally, the same two-layer strategy
        as ``test_mid_dotstar_chain_spam_stays_linear``. A regression has to break
        one of these to reintroduce the quadratic:

          1. PRECOMPUTE ONCE PER FRAME -- ``_self_module_flag_scan`` (the single
             pair of linear passes that replaced the per-interpreter-token re-walk)
             runs exactly once for the frame, however many interpreter tokens the
             frame holds;
          2. WORK PER TOKEN IS CONSTANT -- the ``_normalize_operand`` AND
             ``_is_self_module_flag`` call counts each grow as an exact arithmetic
             progression in the token count (equal size steps produce equal call
             increments). The quadratic this test pins against re-normalized the
             remaining tail once per interpreter token, which makes the increments
             themselves grow with the size and breaks the progression. The flag
             predicate is counted SEPARATELY because a cheaper regression shape
             exists that never re-normalizes: a per-token forward walk over the
             already-precomputed ``scan.norm`` (losing the ``stops`` O(1) jump)
             keeps the normalize count linear, but it must consult the stop
             predicate once per walked token, so that count goes quadratic and
             breaks its progression.

        The absolute budget stays as the machine-independent catastrophic-blowup
        backstop: the pre-fix quadratic spent 1.94s where the bound is 0.5s, and it
        also catches cost added outside the instrumented calls, where the counts

class TestPythonStdinDetectorStepsOverOutputRedirects:
    """An OUTPUT redirect must not be mistaken for the interpreter's script path.

    ``_python_reads_stdin`` decides whether a ``python`` invocation takes its PROGRAM
    from stdin, and the credential-mint floor uses that to know whether to scan the
    stdin carriers (here-string, heredoc, redirect, pipe producer) for a payload that
    imports our CLI.  It read the raw token for ``<`` and for heredocs but had no branch
    for the ``>`` family at all, so those tokens fell through to "a positional that is
    not ``-`` is a script path" and the answer became False.

    The unnumbered glued form survived by accident: ``_normalize_operand`` reduces
    ``>out.txt`` to the empty string and the loop skips empties.  ``2>&1`` reduces to
    ``2`` -- a perfectly good file name -- so the interpreter looked like it was running
    a script called ``2``, and the program on its stdin went unscanned.  Eight spellings
    reached the floor that way, verified against bash to actually run the here-string:

        python 2>&1 <<< '<program>'          python 2>> log <<< '<program>'
        python 1>&2 <<< '<program>'          python >& out <<< '<program>'
        python 2> /dev/null <<< '<program>'  python 3>&1 <<< '<program>'
        python > out.txt <<< '<program>'     python <<< '<program>' 2>&1

    The last one is worth its own note: the here-string is consumed correctly there, and
    a redirect AFTER it still flipped the verdict, because the walk continues past the
    carrier and met the leftover ``2``.  So this was not only about redirects preceding
    the payload.

        operator was quadratic in its length -- on a floor that runs for every command,

        Asserted DETERMINISTICALLY, not by timing: a doubling ratio false-reds on a
        starved shared runner whose scheduler noise exceeds the ratio's slack (see
        ``test_the_scan_is_linear_not_quadratic`` for the observed case), so what
        makes the walk linear is asserted structurally instead. The fix's contract is
        that a chain word is walked ONCE, IN PLACE: ``_output_redirect_scan`` returns
        an index precisely so the caller can advance through the same string rather
        than re-slice it. A regression has to break one of these:

          1. ONE SCAN PER OPERATOR -- the ``_output_redirect_scan`` invocation
             count grows as an exact arithmetic progression in the chain length
             (equal size steps produce equal call increments; per-operator
             re-injection or retry work makes the increments themselves grow);
          2. THE FULL WORD EVERY TIME -- every invocation receives a string of the
             chain word's full length. Re-slicing the remainder per operator (the
             quadratic) hands the scan progressively shorter COPIES, each of which
             costs the slice that made it;
          3. THE START INDEX ADVANCES -- strictly increasing within the word, never
             reset to 0, so each character is visited once.

        The absolute budget stays as the machine-independent catastrophic-blowup

          1. PRECOMPUTE ONCE PER CALL -- ``_next_stop_indexes`` runs exactly
             TWICE per call (the env-split stop table and the past-the-dashes
             run-skip table), however many tokens the command holds;
          2. WORK PER TOKEN IS CONSTANT -- the ``_program_basename`` call count
             grows as an exact arithmetic progression in the token count (equal
             size steps produce equal call increments).  The quadratic this test
             pins against re-walked the whole tail once per shell token, which
             makes the increments themselves grow with the size and breaks the
             progression;
          3. NO PER-SHELL-TOKEN RE-WALK -- the ``_is_shell_command_flag`` and
             ``_is_not_double_dash`` call counts each hold to an exact arithmetic
             progression too.  These are the predicates a per-shell-token forward
             re-walk has to re-consult once per walked token, so a regression to
             the quadratic breaks their progressions even where the basename
             count above stays linear.

        One stated residual: a re-walk that INLINES the comparisons instead of
        calling the named predicates is not observed by these counts.  The named
        predicates are the contract that keeps the comparisons callable -- the
        stop-table design exists precisely so every consult goes through them --
        and the timing form this replaces could not reliably catch that shape
        either (the ratio measured the runner, not the code).

        No absolute wall-clock cap: coverage tracing on the backend jobs prices
