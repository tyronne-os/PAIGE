"""Computer use on an unsupported platform — import safety and clean refusals.

Two claims are asserted here, and they are what let this whole package ship in a
wheel that installs on Linux and Windows:

* **Import safety (structural).** Importing ANY module in the package — including
  ``macos_ffi`` — must succeed off macOS, because no ``CDLL`` / ``find_library``
  runs at module scope. This is the second of the two mechanisms that keep CI off
  the native path (the first is the suite-wide fake registration, pinned in
  ``test_computer_use_backend.py``).
* **Clean refusals.** With ``IS_MACOS`` monkeypatched False, every tool returns a
  coherent ``"Error: ..."`` string naming the platform instead of raising — the same
  posture ``dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`` takes for the Windows PTY.

The whole file runs on every shard: the platform is simulated by flipping
``platform_compat`` flags, never by needing that OS.
