"""Tests for macOS TCC-protected home-directory pruning.

macOS gates ~/Downloads, ~/Documents, ~/Desktop (etc.) behind TCC, and records
consent PER (app, folder) pair — so a single unscoped walk rooted at $HOME
that reaches three of them produces THREE consent modals. The walks that only
touched those folders incidentally (as a $HOME catch-all fallback) prune them.

Walks the user explicitly scoped — a project dir, or ~/Downloads itself — are
NOT pruned: that access is deliberate and macOS's own one-time prompt is the
expected contract.
