"""Regression tests for KnowledgeStore sqlite access from worker threads.

KnowledgeStore is created on the event-loop thread, but HybridRetriever.search()
runs on mc-embed executor threads (dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py
search_for_context via run_in_embed_pool). A shared sqlite3 connection carries
creating-thread affinity (check_same_thread=True default), so every
worker-thread query would raise sqlite3.ProgrammingError -> HTTP 500 on
/api/knowledge/search-for-context. KnowledgeStore hands each thread its own
WAL connection via a thread-local ``db`` property; these tests pin that
contract.

# ── In-memory graph thread-safety ──
# The thread-local sqlite fix (above) removed a de-facto guard: previously the
# shared connection raised sqlite3.ProgrammingError in _keyword_search before
# _graph_search ran, so the in-memory graph was never traversed cross-thread.
# With per-thread connections, HybridRetriever.search() reaches the graph leg on
# an mc-embed thread (get_neighbors -> successors/predecessors/nodes) while the
# event-loop thread mutates the SAME SimpleDiGraph inline (ingest add_entity/
# add_entity_relation, dedup -> _load_graph clear()+rebuild). The graph is a
# single shared instance of plain dicts; concurrent iterate + clear/insert
# raised "dictionary changed size during iteration" (HTTP 500) or returned a
# half-rebuilt graph. SimpleDiGraph now guards all access with an RLock and
# snapshots iterating reads.
