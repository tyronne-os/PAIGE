"""Integration test: several REAL stub processes must share ONE backend.

Every other gateway test drives the stub seam in-process -- ``attach_stub("s1")``
takes a string label, not a process. That leaves the one property pooling exists
for completely unasserted: *do N independent client processes end up behind a
single MCP server?*

This matters because a pooling failure is SILENT. When the handshake breaks the
stub degrades to per-session ``exec`` (``stub.py``'s always-degrade guarantee),
so every tool call still works, no error surfaces, and the only difference is
that the memory saving is gone. Two such failures were found during the Windows
port and both presented as "everything works":

* ``os.getuid()`` in the Register frame raised on Windows, so pooling had never
  once taken effect there;
* the peer-identity check ran before the first pipe read, so admission denied
  100% of connections.

Assertions that say "nothing errored" cannot catch either. Counting the backends
can, so that is what this module does -- and it counts them from the OUTSIDE, by
having the spawned server append a line per launch, rather than by reading the
pool's private dict. A closed-box count survives refactors of the pool internals.

Platform coverage is the whole point, so this file deliberately contains no
platform branch other than where the endpoint is placed. Permission modes
(POSIX ``chmod`` vs Windows DACL) and identity verdicts (``SO_PEERCRED`` vs
token SID vs macOS ``UNVERIFIABLE``) are genuinely platform-shaped and are
covered by their own platform-split tests; folding them in here would turn this
into a per-platform mock farm and cost the portability that
:mod:`kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.transport` was written to provide.

``test_pool_integ_is_never_silently_skipped_on_windows`` guards the coverage
itself: a Windows skip would remove the only positive proof of pooling on the
platform where the transport is newest, and would do it while CI stayed green.

    exist at all and ``getattr(..., [])`` silently yields an empty set. Every
    membership assertion against it then passes vacuously, which is precisely
    the class of false pass this guard exists to prevent. Reading the file is
    platform-independent.

    The names used to be string literals inside conftest and were extracted by
    parsing its AST. They now live in ``windows-collect-ignore.txt`` because a
    second reader needs them: naming a file explicitly on the pytest command
    line bypasses ``collect_ignore``, so the CI reduced-scope selector
    (``scripts/ci-surface-tests.py``) has to apply the same exclusion itself.
    Reading that file keeps this guard pointed at the real source of truth --
