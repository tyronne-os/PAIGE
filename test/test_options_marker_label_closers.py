"""A closer stays in an ``[OPTIONS:]`` label only where it is
MATCHED by an earlier ``[``, or where it CONTINUES the label list.

A label may legitimately carry a closer -- ``[OPTIONS: Alpha ] | Bravo ]]`` is a
supported, tested shape -- so the body has to admit one. Admitting it
UNCONDITIONALLY (the old ``[^[\\n]``, which includes ``]``) made the body run to
the LAST closer in range instead of the first plausible one, so an ordinary final
line that mentions a bracket after the marker matched across BOTH::

    Use [OPTIONS: A | B] then check arr[0]

matched whole. Every consumer removes the whole match -- ``slack.format`` and
``messaging.renderer`` cut the visible text at ``match.start()``, and
``whatsapp.turn_renderer`` PERSISTS the cut turn -- so the sentence vanished from
the message and came back as a pill label. Under TRAILER (``DOTALL``) the body
crossed blank lines too, so the whole final paragraph went with it.

NEITHER condition alone is enough, which is why the rule is a union of two:

===================================== ================== ==========
input                                 admitted by        outcome
===================================== ================== ==========
``[OPTIONS: Fix [x] logging | Skip]``  matched pair       parses
``[OPTIONS: Alpha ] | Bravo ]]``       list continues     parses
``Use [OPTIONS: A | B] ... arr[0]``    neither            declined
===================================== ================== ==========

The first row is pinned independently by ``test_parse_options.py`` and
``test_options_buttons.py``, whose comments call it out as supported: continuation
alone would have broken it, so this suite asserts it here too, as the guard it is.

Two claims are asserted separately throughout, because they are different and only
the second is what the user experiences: that the grammar does not MATCH, and that
``sub`` leaves the text UNCHANGED. ``TestAcceptedCosts`` extends the second claim
one step further down, to ``split_options_trailer``, because narrowing the grammar
is what made that function's partial-cut gate load-bearing: a marker the grammar
declines must not be silently deleted by the consumer instead.

Under an unconditional closer, every case in
``OVERREACH`` and ``TRAILER_OVERREACH`` matches whole and deletes the prose shown.
