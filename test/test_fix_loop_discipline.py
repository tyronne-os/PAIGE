"""The fix-loop discipline stays wired: pattern harvest in, untracked deferrals out.

Two mechanisms exist because this repository measured its own fix loop: 75% of
escaped defects were preventable, and the largest traceable class was findings a
reviewer raised and a disposition deferred without follow-through. The pattern-
harvest half turns each fix into a rule candidate; the deferral half makes every
deferred finding a tracked promise (label + owner + due date).

Each half is spread across surfaces that cannot see each other — a PR template,
a hygiene step, a semgrep rule, a review-prompt rule, two workflows, and a
skill. Losing any one piece silently reopens the gap the others assume closed,
and nothing else fails when that happens. So this file pins the wiring: it does
not care how the guidance is worded, only that every load-bearing piece is
still there and still pointed at the same names.
