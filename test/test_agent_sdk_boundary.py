"""GATE — the agent-SDK boundary is declared, classified, and shrink-only.

``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`` refuses new imports of the ACP layer from
application code. This test pins the three properties that make that gate
trustworthy rather than decorative, in the shape the sibling architecture gates
use (``test_messaging_import_purity.py``, ``test_workflows_architecture.py``):

1. **The exempt set is exactly the boundary.** Only ``agent_sdk/``, ``acp/`` and
   ``providers/`` may reach the ACP layer, the set is pinned here, and each
   prefix must name a directory that exists. Widening the boundary fails a test
   rather than passing quietly.
2. **The recorded violations still exist.** A baseline entry that has been paid
   off must be pruned, or the list stops shrinking and starts lying.
3. **The scan cannot be walked around.** ``TYPE_CHECKING``-only imports,
   relative imports, ``importlib.import_module`` and a bound name that IS the
   forbidden package (``from kiro_crew import acp``) are all in scope, and the
   probes below fail if any of them stops being caught.

If this goes RED you either added an ACP import outside the boundary or paid one
off without recording it. Fix the import direction or run
``--update-baseline`` — do not relax the rule.
