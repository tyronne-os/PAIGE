"""``_ingest_file`` must neither query per file nor await after the commit.

Two defects meet in this one function, and the fix for the first used to create
the second -- so both are ratcheted here together.

**The query.** The scan used to learn which items a file produced by reading the
source's entire item-id set BEFORE and AFTER every single file and diffing the two.
``idx_items_source_id`` keeps each read an index scan rather than a table scan, but
it still materializes one row per item in the SOURCE -- about 20k rows on a large
folder source, measured at over a second per call -- twice per file, synchronously
on the event loop. That trips the loop-stall watchdog, which exits the process; the
supervisor respawns it, the boot scan re-enters the same reads, and the gateway
crash-loops. Observed against a 2709-file source: four watchdog exits inside 17
minutes, with 7-9s of loop lag still reported between them.

**The orphan window.** Merely moving those reads to a worker thread introduces a
DIFFERENT bug, which is why this file also ratchets awaits. The pipeline commits
the new items inside its own uncancellable ``run_to_completion`` finalize hop, and
the caller (``_do_scan``) writes the ``folder_file_state`` row that NAMES them only
after ``_ingest_file`` returns. Any await between that commit and this function's
return is therefore a window where a gateway shutdown cancels the coroutine,
committed items end up named by no state row, and the next scan re-ingests the file
-- duplicating them while the first group stays untracked and undeletable.

Both are closed by the same change: the pipeline already reports its created ids
through ``on_committed``, invoked INSIDE the finalize hop that commits them. Taking
the ids from there means no read to offload and no post-commit await to cancel.
