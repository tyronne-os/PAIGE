"""The runtime frontend rebuild must recompose the EDITION, not stage stock over it.

``POST /api/update``, ``kirocrew update``, and the gateway's auto-apply all shell
``npm run build`` and stage the result over the served ``static/dist``. Vite reads
the edition composition root from the environment
(``website/vite.config.ts``::``editionExtensionPlugin``), so what those rebuilds
pass in the environment decides WHICH edition gets built.

Dropping the edition vars is silent, which is why these are tests rather than a
comment: the rebuild would build the STOCK SPA and stage it over the edition
dashboard, and because the build SUCCEEDS nothing raises — the dashboard just
becomes upstream's.

The opt-in is READ, never synthesized. ``KIROCREW_ALLOW_EDITION=1`` gates
compiling an edition's proprietary sources into ``website/dist``, which is staged
into the packaged wheel; a published release cannot be unpublished, so that is a
one-way door and ``website/AGENTS.md`` says never to set the opt-in outside the
edition's own build. A helper that forced it would defeat the gate exactly when it
should fire, so an edition dir without the operator's opt-in declines and lets
vite raise its own explicit error.

A packaged install (wheel/bundle) ships the built ``dist`` but not the edition's
TypeScript sources, so a rebuild there can only produce a stock bundle — the
build is SKIPPED instead, leaving the shipped dashboard in place.
