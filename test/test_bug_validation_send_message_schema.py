"""RED test for SEND_MESSAGE_SCHEMA caller_session pattern defect.

The caller_session FieldSpec in SEND_MESSAGE_SCHEMA must accept the same
two-segment ``cron:<job_id>:<run_id>`` form that CRON_SESSION_RE documents and
accepts. The buggy inline pattern ``^(cron:[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?$`` only matches the
single-segment ``cron:<job_id>`` form, so a legitimate two-segment caller_session
is wrongly rejected.

Also pins the *advertise/validate parity* half of the same defect class: the
schema this file guards is the one ``mcp_core._validate_args`` enforces, and
``validate_tool_args`` REJECTS an unknown field outright — so a property the
``send_message`` descriptor advertises to the model but the schema does not
declare is a tool argument that can never be passed. Nothing at runtime notices,
because the two halves live in different modules.
