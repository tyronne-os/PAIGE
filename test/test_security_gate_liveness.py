"""Liveness tests for the shell-command gate.

``is_sensitive_bash_command`` runs synchronously on the gateway's event loop,
under a loop-stall watchdog that hard-exits the process after 25 s of silence
(``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs``). A field crash (a cron whose agent
emitted a ~9 KB command full of ``https://`` URLs) traced to the gate, whose
path-matching passes were quadratic in the command. Those passes are gone -- the
gate no longer matches paths in command text at all -- and what it still runs
(the size ceiling, the IMDS detector and the environment-credential detector) is
pinned here at the crash size, under the ceiling, where it is what the loop
actually pays. The ceiling itself is pinned as a refusal, not a skip: a command
too long to scan is denied rather than let through unscanned.
