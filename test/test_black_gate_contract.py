"""The black gate must be real, and the docs must describe the gate that exists.

This repository ran for a long time with `black --check` commented out in CI while
`AGENTS.md` listed `black src/kiro_crew test` as a gate to run before committing.
That is a worse failure than a missing gate: following the documented command
reformats ~95,800 lines across 1,420 pre-existing files, so a contributor either
buries their own diff or knowingly skips a documented step. Both happened.

These tests pin the two halves that have to stay true together -- CI enforces
black, and no document tells anyone to run it in the form that hurts.
