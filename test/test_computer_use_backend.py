"""Computer use — the backend seam contract (ABC + registry + one platform branch).

Everything here runs on every CI shard, including the Linux and Windows ones,
because the whole point of the seam is that no native framework is loaded until
:func:`select_default_backend` is actually called — and the Windows / Linux
degradation paths are exercised by flipping a ``platform_compat`` flag rather than
by needing that OS.

The headline tripwire is ``test_ci_never_selects_a_native_backend``: the suite-wide
autouse fixture in ``conftest.py`` must keep ``get_shared_backend()`` on the fake,
so no test anywhere can capture a real window or touch a real application.

        * ``macos_ffi.py`` guards its framework load (raising
          ``ComputerUseUnsupported`` off macOS) — the one place a native load must be
          refused regardless of what the selector chose;

          ``IS_WINDOWS`` for it. A native guard asks about its OWN platform, so the
          flag it may read is the one its libraries belong to — that is still a
          local bail-out rather than a competing selector, because it answers "can I
          load" and never "which backend should exist";
        * ``launch_windows.py`` guards its file-OWNER lookup, which calls ``advapi32``
          through ``ctypes.WinDLL``. Same shape as the two native guards above: it asks
          "can I make this call here", and answers ``None`` — "ownership unknown", which
          the caller treats as untrusted — rather than raising on a Linux CI runner where
          the module is imported but never used;
        * ``permissions.py`` is reached directly by the dashboard's ``doctor --json``
          probe, whose whole point is learning the TCC state WITHOUT loading a
          driver, so it must answer ``unsupported`` on its own;
        * ``overlay.py`` / ``overlay_proc.py`` are Cursor Motion, a COSMETIC
          subsystem that never consults the driver seam at all (it draws a fake
          pointer; it reads no window and captures no pixels), so it cannot learn
          "is this macOS?" from a backend it never asks. The supervisor declines to
          spawn and the renderer declines to build a window.

        An extra reader anywhere else fails here. Matched by AST attribute access,
        not substring: the driver docstrings NAME these flags to explain how the
