"""A secret-bearing file must be locked down BEFORE it is published.

Applying the owner-only lockdown after the payload is already at its final path
leaves a window in which the file exists under whatever permissions it
inherited. On Windows that is the parent directory's DACL, and POSIX mode bits
are not enforced there at all, so ``atomic_write(mode=0o600)`` does not close
it. Issue #5307 converted the last seven such writers to
``atomic_write(..., restrict_to_owner=True)``, which locks the temp file down
before the first content byte and before the rename.

Nothing prevented a NEW writer from reintroducing the shape. Two layers here:

* ``scripts/check_lockdown_before_publish.py`` is an AST rule over
  ``src/kiro_crew``, exercised below against fixtures for every shape it must
  catch and every correct shape it must not. Validated against real history:
  run against the tree before #5329 it flags 6/6 of #5307's sites; against
  ``main`` after it, 0/6.
* behavioural probes assert the ORDER at the live writers, rather than the
  final mode -- a final-mode assertion passes just as happily when the payload
  was exposed for the whole write window, and on NTFS reports ``0o666``
  regardless of the DACL. The technique (record whether the FINAL path exists
  at the moment lockdown runs) is from PR #5314 by @leonlaiyc, whose
  production change landed via #5329.
