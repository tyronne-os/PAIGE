"""Repairing a stale adopted daemon, not just reporting it.

``test_mcp_gateway_target_map_drift`` pins the DETECTION half: an adopted
survivor whose baked target map no longer covers the configured stub set is
found and warned about, and an unknown target at the pre-flight degrades to a
per-session exec instead of dying. What that leaves is the cost the warning
itself names -- pooling and the strict session key stay lost for every drifted
server, for as long as the daemon holds the socket.

This module pins the REPAIR: the incumbent is asked to release the socket, and a
daemon carrying the current map binds in its place.

Doing it by asking rather than taking is the whole design. The starting gateway
must not unlink the endpoint itself: ``_clear_stale_socket`` is a
connect-probe-then-unlink whose documented false-stale window would take a LIVE
incumbent's socket, which is the socket-theft class the flock guard exists to
prevent. A voluntary stand-down has no such window -- the request only ever
reaches a daemon that just answered on that socket.

Three properties beyond "it works" are pinned here, each found by review:

* the wait is on the singleton LOCK, not the endpoint (they part company for a
  daemon's whole drain on Windows);
* a daemon that ACCEPTED but is still draining is never adopted (it accepts
  nothing, so adopting it is worse than the drift);
* an incumbent that REFUSES is still adopted, exactly as before, because it is
  still serving -- the fail-open is deliberate and must not regress.

Every test that starts a real daemon isolates KIROCREW_HOME and the working
directory: the suite sets neither, and ``manager._gatewayd_log_path`` falls back
to ``config_dir()`` -- the operator's real data home -- while a spawned daemon
inherits pytest's CWD, which is the checkout.
