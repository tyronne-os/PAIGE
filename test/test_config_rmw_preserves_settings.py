    """No direct ``write_config_atomically(config_path())`` caller may reappear (#8032).

    ``update_config_locked`` holds an advisory lock on a ``<path>.lock`` sidecar
    for its whole read-modify-write. Its guarantee is only as strong as the set
    of writers that participate: a writer that renames ``config.json`` without
    taking that lock can land between a participant's read and write, and the
    second rename wins with a document that never saw the other's change. The
    loss is silent and the lost data is user configuration.

    That list was drained once by hand (the dashboard agents endpoint,
    ``security.py``, the apps manager, the CLI setup wizard). Without a ratchet
    it regrows: the write is one obvious line and nothing about it announces the
    lock it is missing. So this walks the AST rather than asserting on a
    hand-maintained list, in the shape ``TestNoFailOpenConfigWriters`` above
    established.

    **What it does NOT cover.** Only calls to ``write_config_atomically``. A
    second family of writers reaches ``config.json`` through
    ``kiro_crew.agent._atomic_json_write`` (``messaging.py``'s channel savers,
    ``core.py``'s STT PUT, ``mcp.py``'s gateway-enable) and still bypasses the
    lock. :meth:`KiroCrewConfig.save` (``updates.py``'s log-level PUT, the
    workspace CRUD in ``files.py``, several ``agents.py`` CRUD endpoints) used
    to be in that family and no longer is: since #4767 it holds the same
    ``<path>.lock`` sidecar — see ``TestSaveHoldsTheAdvisoryLock`` in
    ``test_config_save_locking.py``. Green here does not mean every config
    writer is locked -- it means this class of them is.
