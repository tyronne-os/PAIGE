"""Tests for Response Verbosity (``default`` / ``concise`` / ``ultra`` / ``answer_only``).

Lives under ``test/`` (the collected root per setup.cfg ``testpaths``) so these
run in CI. Covers three layers: the ``{{VERBOSITY_BLOCK}}`` prompt-template
resolution, the dashboard-config PUT/GET validation, and a guard that the
