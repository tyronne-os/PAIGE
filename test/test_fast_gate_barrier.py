"""The Fast Gate barrier: what `await-fast-gate` must guarantee for the split to be safe.

The cheap blocking gates live in ``.github/workflows/fast-gate.yml`` so that
two consumers can key on them before the expensive work starts: ci.yml's heavy jobs
wait through ``await-fast-gate``, and the five fork reviewers trigger on the
workflow's completion. A ``needs:`` edge cannot cross a workflow file, so that
barrier is a job that READS the other workflow's run -- and everything that makes a
read trustworthy has to be asserted, because none of it is enforced by GitHub.

Three properties, each of which fails silently rather than loudly if it regresses:

1. The barrier identifies the run by the full identity triple. A head SHA is not a
   unique key: two pull requests can carry the same head commit, and each gets its
   own Fast Gate run on it. Keyed on the SHA alone the barrier reads whichever run
   is newest -- possibly another PR's -- and releases this PR's matrix on a gate
   that never ran against its base. Raised as a blocking finding by GPT 5.6 on the
   commit that introduced the barrier.

2. The barrier fails CLOSED in every direction. A barrier that passes when it could
   not read its subject is worse than no barrier, because the matrix runs anyway
   and the log claims it was cleared to.

3. Every job that costs real runner time waits on it, and the jobs that must NOT
   wait on it still do not -- `changes` because it produces the outputs the gating
   conditions read, and the two coverage reporters because a skipped required check
   reads to GitHub as satisfied.
