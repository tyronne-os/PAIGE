"""Retention of a sub-agent's ``result.txt`` is anchored on the parent CONSUMING
the completion, not on the run finishing (issue #4839).

``agent.subagent_result_ttl_secs`` exists so the parent can read the full
transcript after the completion event arrives. The clock is the ``died`` stamp on
the ``delivered`` tombstone, and that used to be written as soon as the gateway
had ROUTED the completion — including the route that only parks the announce in a
busy slot's queue. A queue wait is bounded by the turn ceiling, not by the TTL, so
a wave whose events were delivered two hours later handed the parent result paths
the reaper had already pruned, under the line "Full outputs are on disk".

The fix splits routing from consumption: the gateway records the owed ids on the
slot and leaves the folder un-tombstoned (so nothing prunes it, and a restart can
still recover it), and the queue drain writes the tombstone once the row becomes a
turn.
