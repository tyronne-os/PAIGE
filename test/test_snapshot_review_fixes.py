    Replace then clears the live state for that component with nothing to put back. Measured
    end to end rather than on the mutation phase, because the guard is at the decision point --
    calling `_do_replace_mutations` directly bypasses it and would report the old behaviour.

    Two facts made this worth refusing rather than tolerating. The PRODUCT writes such a bundle:
    a snapshot of a home with no memory payload declares `memory` anyway. And the damage is a
    PARTIAL erasure, which is worse than either extreme -- the memory trees are cleared
    unconditionally and the derived index is removed, while `memory.db` survives because the
    bundle has no copy to install. The database is kept and the notes indexed against it are not.

    The explicit-selection branch already refused this exact situation, with the rationale that
    replace "would move the live files of that component out to the rollback dir and have
    nothing to put back". Only the manifest-derived branch was missing the check.

        passed the guard that exists for exactly this situation: `memory` IS declared, so
