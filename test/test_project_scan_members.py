"""Tests for workspace declarations and the member candidates they produce.

A member list is the one input to the scan that comes from a file rather than
from the shape of the tree, which makes it the one place a project can ask for
something the scan must refuse. So these tests pin both halves:

1. **Parsing.** Each of the four formats is read in the spellings real projects
   use, a file that merely lacks a member list is not an error, and a file that
   cannot be understood costs a warning rather than the scan.
2. **Resolution.** Patterns expand relative to the package that declared them,
   a member is offered unticked unless it already earned a stronger tier, and a
   member that would escape the root, sit under a pruned directory, cross a
   symlink, or fall past the depth cap never becomes a candidate.
