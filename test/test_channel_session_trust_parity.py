"""One session-trust grant, five channels.

Webex, WeCom, iLink (weixin) and iMessage all render no approve/deny widget, so
each runs the shared pipeline with ``decider=None``. Under the default
INTERACTIVE approval mode that is deny-by-default with nothing able to say
otherwise: every tool call is rejected and the agent can only talk. Each
therefore also passes ``ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session``, reading the SAME
process-global ``safety_override`` grant the dashboard toggle and Slack's
``/kirocrew yolo`` drive -- so an operator who arms it anywhere gets tool use on
these channels too, and it still expires.

Teams is enrolled too even though it DOES have a widget (:data:`_WIDGET_CHANNELS`).
It passes the SAME predicate as the four -- it keeps no grant of its own, so its
card button and its ``/yolo`` both arm this one shared grant -- and its card only
changes what happens with NO grant: a prompt is posted and awaited instead of an
immediate refusal. Enrolling it is the point: nothing else drives a real permission
request through Teams' ``handle_message``, so both ``decider=`` and
``auto_approve_session=`` could be deleted from its ``ChannelTurn`` with every
Teams test still green.

One parameterized suite rather than five near-copies, because the property is
identical in all five and a per-channel copy is how one of them silently loses
the wiring. Every case drives that channel's real ``handle_message`` through the
real ``drive_turn`` and the real ``TurnDriver``, so what is pinned is the whole
path rather than the presence of a keyword:

* with no grant the tool is still rejected -- immediately on the four buttonless
  channels, and after the card's deadline passes on Teams -- and a widget is
  offered ONLY where a press can resolve one,
* with the grant armed the same tool is approved with no widget and no decider,
* the predicate is re-read per tool rather than snapshotted when the turn was
  built, and
* a hard PreToolUse deny still wins, because the security gate runs AHEAD of
  this rung.
