"""``kirocrew-cron`` resolves the calling session from the injected caller block.

The server used to read identity from its own process environment. On a pooled
backend one process serves many sessions, so process environment can only ever
name one of them -- and gatewayd forwards no session-identifying variable to a
shared backend at all, so what it actually read there was EMPTY. Every
session-scoped path then took the empty branch, and those branches disagreed with
each other: the per-job ownership gate allowed, ``cron_list`` skipped its filter,
``cron_add`` stored an ownerless row, and only ``cron_remove_all`` refused. Two of
those are fail-open, which made the ownership gate dead code for exactly the
callers it exists to separate.

What these tests pin, in the order the fix depends on them:

1. The caller block WINS over the process environment -- asserted with the
   environment naming a DIFFERENT session, because a test that merely reads the
   block back would also pass if the block were being ignored in favour of an
   environment that happened to agree.
2. With no block, the environment still resolves, so a non-gateway launch is not
   regressed.
3. The forgeable source is no longer consulted for an authorization decision.
4. One rule for an unidentifiable caller: writes refuse, and its read scope is
   empty rather than waved through.
5. A row with no recorded owner is outside every session's scope, for reading and
   writing alike, and its refusal is indistinguishable from "no such job". Every
   creation path that has no session to name keeps writing such rows (the CLI, the
   importer), so this is a permanent scope rule, not a drainable exemption.

# to channel posts. cron_add/cron_update let it schedule a durable job that runs
# as a MORE privileged agent, so both are denied here at MCP dispatch -- keyed on
# the verified caller identity, because an auto-approved call (cron in the
# agent's allowedTools) fires no permission event for channel.py's guard to see.
