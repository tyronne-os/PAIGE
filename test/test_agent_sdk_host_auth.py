"""One declaration per harness is the only place an auth fact may live.

Four host controls have to name the same file for a harness to be both fenced and
able to authenticate: the read-gate floor spells the credential leaf, the sandbox
mask spells the one leaf to spare, a membership set spells whether a host logout
may retire a running child, and the panel spells the sign-in advice. While each
was hand-maintained, a harness became selectable with its live OAuth token off the
floor -- the list that was supposed to carry it was edited somewhere else.

``agent_sdk.host_auth`` makes that one table and the four controls projections of
it. These tests pin the properties that make the projection trustworthy, and each
one fails for a different reason:

* a selectable harness with no declaration is a harness with no auth answer, so
  the parity gate must fail when the known set grows without the table growing;
* the table is read from inside the credential floor's own construction, so it
  must stay a stdlib-only leaf or the floor cannot read it without a cycle;
* each projection must still equal the table it replaced, and be reachable from
  the consumer that actually reads it -- a correct table nobody reads fences
  nothing;
* a driver must not be able to unmask itself, which is the one asymmetry the
  declaration's own validation exists to enforce;
* an unnamed harness must fail CLOSED -- fence nothing extra, and never have a
  live turn ended over a store there is no evidence it reads;
* an in-product sign-in flow is optional, and its absence has to be visible as a
  shape rather than as a flag a driver sets and then no-ops; and
* the resolved-root cache key must change whenever a declared override would move
  a target, because keying on less than the builder anchors on serves targets
  computed for a stale root.
