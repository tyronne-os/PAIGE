"""The sources.sync_status COLUMN is the single source of truth.

A source's sync state used to live in two places: the ``sources.sync_status``
column and a ``sync_status`` key inside the ``properties`` JSON blob. Writers
were split across the two -- most transitions wrote the column only, while the
watcher's 'missing' marker went into the blob only -- and readers were split the
same way, so each side saw a state the other had not written.

These tests pin the converged contract on the watcher paths that read and write
it: the pre-scan skip reads the column, and the missing marker is written to the
column and can be left again.
