"""Tests for how a JSON-RPC error frame reaches the user.

``AcpSessionHandle`` (the shared-runtime path every dashboard chat takes) used
to raise ``AcpError(f"ACP error: {msg.error}")`` — a ``repr`` of the raw
``{code, message, data}`` dict — so a routine model-unavailable failure landed
in the transcript as an unreadable red wall:

    ACP error: {'code': -32603, 'message': 'Internal error', 'data':
    "Encountered an error in the response stream: The model 'claude-opus-4.8'
    is not available. Please use '/model' to select a different model and try
    again. (request_id: ...)"}

Meanwhile ``AcpClient`` — the other producer of the identical frame — routed
through ``_raise_acp_error``, which rewrites known failure modes into recovery
steps, redacts credentials, and raises ``AcpPromptBusy`` for a concurrent
prompt. Both handle sites now delegate to that helper, so the two producers
cannot drift.

The raw dump was quietly LOAD-BEARING: ``chat_runner`` decided prompt-busy
retry eligibility by searching the message for "already in progress", which
only ever matched because the dict was echoed verbatim. Formatting rewrites
that marker away, so the runner's check is now structural
(``isinstance(exc, AcpPromptBusy)``) with the string kept as a fallback. The
coupling guard below fails if a future reformat re-breaks it.

Both handle sites also pass the session's advertised model ids, so the
entitlement discriminator added by #1550 (``_model_is_unentitled``) actually
fires on this path. #1550 wired only the ``AcpClient`` sites, and this handle
is the path every dashboard chat takes.
