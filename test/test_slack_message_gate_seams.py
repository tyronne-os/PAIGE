"""Tests for the Slack message-gate + token-anchor + reply-decorator seams.

Three v1 CPP method additions that let an edition compose a "challenge-and-
redirect" Slack posture without editing the core:

  * ``SlackEnterpriseGate.intercept_message`` — called at the top of
    ``_route_message``; Default ``PROCESS`` keeps the OSS inline behavior.
  * ``DashboardContributor.on_token_consumed`` — the anchor fired after
    ``bind_token_ip``; Default no-op.
  * ``DashboardContributor.decorate_reply`` — the outbound-reply transform;
    Default identity.

These tests pin the OSS-preserving Defaults and the ``InterceptDecision`` /
short-circuit contract the companion depends on. They do NOT exercise a real
challenge flow (that lives in the companion) — only that the public core exposes
the seam and behaves byte-identically until a companion overrides it.
