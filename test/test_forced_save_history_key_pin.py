"""expected_history_key pin at the tags/folders forced-save call sites (#7519).

``save_slot_off_loop`` / ``_save_slot_to_history`` resolve their target
transcript from live routing at write time, so a ``linked_session_key`` rebind
during the persist await can redirect a durable write to a transcript the
caller never authorized against. PR #7346 added the ``expected_history_key``
refuse-if-moved pin (save returns ``False``, writing nothing, when the live
key has moved off the pinned one) and wired it at the autocompact endpoint;
these tests pin the REMAINING forced-save sites the same way, mirroring
``test_session_autocompact_override.TestExpectedHistoryKeyPin``:

- ``chat_tags``: the tag-delete slot strip, PUT slot tags, and the drag-drop
  status reassign.
- ``chat_folders``: the folder-delete unfile loop and its restore rollback,
  PATCH slot folder, PATCH slot pin, and PATCH slot mode.

Two layers:

- Real-save tests drive an endpoint through the REAL save with the routing
  rebound mid-persist, asserting the refusal propagates (409, rollback) and
  that neither the pinned nor the foreign transcript received the write.
- Disposition tests stub the save to refuse (``False``) and assert each call
  site's documented handling: the direct mutation endpoints roll back and
  return 409 ``session_gone`` (the autocompact disposition); the drag-drop
  endpoint answers in its own rejection shape (``ok: False`` + reason); the
  best-effort cleanup loops mark the slot dirty and keep going. Every stubbed
  call also proves the pin was captured from the PRE-rebind routing.
