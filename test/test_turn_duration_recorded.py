"""Every dispatch surface must record a REAL turn duration.

Regression guard for the row-store half of the ``duration_ms: 0`` defect. The
OTEL histogram was fixed separately (per-instrument buckets); the row store kept
reading ``TurnUsage.duration_ms``, which the acp provider never assigns, so every
real row in ``<data home>/usage/tokens/*.jsonl`` carried a literal 0 and the
Telemetry page could not answer "how long did this turn take".

The fix threads a caller-measured ``elapsed_ms`` into the record builder as the
FALLBACK for ``duration_ms``. These tests lock in three properties:

1. the fallback fires when the provider reports nothing (the acp reality),
2. a provider that DOES report still wins (so the fallback is not a clobber),
3. every persist call site actually passes a measured value — the property that
   would silently rot as new dispatch surfaces are added.

Property 3 is enforced structurally (AST over the real source), not by mocking
each surface: a mock-per-surface suite passes happily while a NEW surface added
next quarter forgets the argument entirely.
