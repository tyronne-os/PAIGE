"""Pin the server-side facts prepare-pr's disposition guidance relies on.

SKILL.md tells the agent to write a disposition's rationale in ``> `` lines,
at class level, and to argue not-a-defect (never merely disproportional) for a
security-class rebuttal. Each of those instructions is only correct because of
a specific property of the GPT lane's convergence machinery:

- the ADJUDICATION LEDGER keeps only the marker line, ``> `` lines and
  ``- **`` title bullets from each disposition comment (so prose outside them
  never reaches the reviewer), capped per record;
- convergence rule 1 lets a recorded rationale cover every instance of the
  tradeoff it names (so a class-level rebuttal converges the class);
- convergence rule 5 refuses a deferral as a ruling on a security / data-loss /
  corruption finding (so the skill must not teach deferral for that class).

The skill relaxed three local hard limits on the strength of those properties.
If any of them drifts, the skill's advice becomes silently wrong, so pin them
here the way ``test_prepare_pr_profiles.py`` pins the reviewer budgets.
