"""The dashboard's RecoveryCard detects recovery rows by content prefix.

Recovery continuations are appended as plain ``inject`` rows whose meta is a CSS
class string, so the only signal the frontend has is the literal prefix text.
If a prefix constant changes here without the TSX changing too, the card
silently stops rendering and the raw machine-facing prompt reappears as a
full-width bubble -- a regression with no test failure anywhere else.
