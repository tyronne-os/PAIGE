"""The Main Ratchet Audit must measure every gate, and describe only main.

The audit's concurrency group is keyed on the SHA, so audits for DIFFERENT
commits run concurrently and finish in whatever order their runners take. The
per-commit verdict is exactly what that buys, and it stays sound. The single
tracking issue is not per-commit though -- it is shared mutable state -- so a
run that finishes after a newer push must not write its verdict there:

* A slow **green** run would close the drift record a newer push just opened,
  turning a live ratchet failure on main into no record at all. That is the same
  false all-clear the whole workflow exists to close, arriving through the
  reporter instead of through an empty diff scope.
* A slow **drifting** run would open or refresh a record against a tree that has
  since been fixed, so main reads as dirty when it is clean.

Two further ways the lane could report a verdict that means less than it looks
are pinned at the bottom of this module: a gate ADDED to ``ci.yml`` or to
``fast-gate.yml`` (the split-out cheap blocking gates ci.yml waits on) and not
mirrored here would never be measured on the integrated tree, and a gate step
left on the default ``success()`` condition would skip every later gate as soon
as one drifted.

These are behavioural properties of a shell step, not of its prose, so they are
pinned by running the step itself against a stubbed ``gh``. The alternative --
grepping the workflow for a comparison -- passes on a step that compares the two
SHAs and then closes the issue anyway.
