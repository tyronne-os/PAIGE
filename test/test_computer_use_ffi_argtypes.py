"""The ctypes binding-discipline tripwire for ``computer_use/macos_ffi.py``.

The single most valuable test in the computer-use suite, and the cheapest: it
pins the exact defect that produced a real ``EXIT=139`` during prototyping.

**A missing ``argtypes`` is a SIGSEGV, not a ``TypeError``.** With no
``argtypes``, ctypes marshals a Python int as a 32-bit C int and TRUNCATES the
64-bit pointer it was given; the callee then dereferences a garbage address. That
is an unrecoverable process fault — no ``except`` can catch it, and in the
gateway it would take the cron scheduler, the Slack socket and every live session
down with it. Prevention is the only mitigation, so this test asserts the
discipline structurally rather than waiting for a crash:

* every ``_FN_SPECS`` row declares BOTH a non-``None`` ``argtypes`` list and a
  ``restype`` (or the explicit ``_VOID`` sentinel, since ``restype = None`` is
  itself meaningful to ctypes and must be distinguishable from "forgot to set
  it");
* ``_bind`` RAISES on ``argtypes=None`` rather than binding a function that would
  fault on first call;
* the struct types the CoreGraphics calls need are real ``ctypes.Structure``
  subclasses (passing two doubles where a ``CGRect`` is expected mis-marshals);
* ``CGEventPostToPid`` is the delivery mechanism for every keyboard, text, scroll
  and app-scoped mouse path (asserted per-function), and the global-tap
  ``CGEventPost`` / ``CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`` are CONFINED to the two
  pointer-moving functions. Both halves are asserted, because either alone is
  satisfiable by a regression: the global tap delivers to whatever is frontmost,
  i.e. whatever the *user* is actually doing, so bounding its call sites is a
  security property and not a style choice — and app-targeted posting being the
  DEFAULT is the other half of the same property.

  Note: the module DOES call ``CGEventPost`` now. The shipped
  ``click_method: "global"`` path deliberately moves the operator's real cursor,
  inverting the original "the pointer never moves" guarantee. It needs no second
  opt-in — there is no ``allow_pointer_move`` keystone flag and no
  ``computer_use.*`` governance scope — but the model must NAME the method
  (``auto`` never resolves onto it) and every use is SEL-audited under its own
  ``tool_kind``. What is pinned here is the CALL-SITE SET, not the symbol's absence.

Runs on every platform: it reads the module's declarative table and its source
text, and never loads a framework or calls a symbol.
