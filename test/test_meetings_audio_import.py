"""Importing an existing recording into a live meeting.

Two halves, tested separately because they fail differently:

* :mod:`...domain.audio` — the pure split from one transcript blob into the lines
  the dispatch transaction expects. Every downstream consumer (transcript append,
  dictionary, noise gate, agent batcher) is per-line, so the boundary rules are the
  feature.
* the route — a file path arriving from a client, which means the interesting tests
  are the refusals and their ORDER, not the happy path.

No model and no audio decoder is ever reached: ``transcribe_audio`` and the
availability probe are patched in every route test.

    ``transcribe_audio`` (and the config/duration helpers beside it) is patched on
    :mod:`kiro_crew.transcribe`, not on this module, because the route imports
    them INSIDE the handler (so a heavy optional dependency is not imported at
    gateway startup). Defaults keep the gate ACTIVE but passing — a cap exists
    and the recording is under it — so every normal-path test exercises the gate
    rather than bypassing it. The snapshot copy is stubbed to write a REAL file
    into the route's snapshot dir (named like the real helper's output): the
    route pins that file with one descriptor and hands both consumers a
    ``/dev/fd`` path, so the stub must produce something openable. The probe
    and transcribe stubs log the CALL-TIME resolution of what they were handed :
    the descriptor is closed before the response returns, so a later resolve
    would fail. Resolution is by INODE (``_consumed``), not ``realpath``: Linux's
    ``/dev/fd/N`` is a symlink that realpath follows to the snapshot file, but on
    macOS it is a devfs node that realpath leaves as ``/dev/fd/N``, so a realpath
    comparison passed on Linux CI and failed on every Mac. ``stat`` on the
    descriptor path returns the open file's identity on both, and identity is the
    guarantee the route actually makes. The real copy helper has its own tests below.
