"""Port baseline: watch-kernel edge cases that nothing else pins.

:mod:`kiro_crew.irq` and its ``gh-pr`` probe carry a long tail of edge cases, and
most of them already have a named test in ``test/test_irq.py`` or
``test/test_babysit_pr_watch.py``. This module holds the remainder: behaviours
that are load-bearing in the kernel and would survive a re-implementation
elsewhere with nothing turning red.

Each test states the behaviour it pins and why the behaviour matters. Where an
existing test already covers a neighbouring behaviour it is cited by name rather
than repeated, so this file adds coverage instead of duplicating it.

Two tests pin an answer the project intends to revisit -- how a signal joining an
open coalescing window is aged, and which entries ride along on a wake they could
not have triggered. Pinning today's answer is what makes a future change to it a
visible diff rather than a silent one.
