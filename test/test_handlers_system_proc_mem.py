"""The system-metrics payload must report LIVE process memory, plus the peak.

``proc_mem_mb`` is rendered on the dashboard as the gateway's current memory. It
was fed by ``ru_maxrss``, a high-water mark that never decreases, so the figure
was a monotonic peak-since-boot that no ``ps -o rss=`` reading could reproduce.
These tests pin which reader feeds which field, because the two are the same
type and the same order of magnitude — transposing them is invisible.
