"""R34 regression tests (round-34 Codex findings on a659f8e).

F1: the deploy_web migration cleanup must run off the event loop
    (asyncio.to_thread) — it does filesystem I/O during gateway startup.
F2: attach/detach backend helpers must NEVER spawn AWS commands without the
    sandbox chokepoint — the ImportError fallback must fail closed.
