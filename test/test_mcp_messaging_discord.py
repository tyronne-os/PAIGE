"""``send_message`` reaching Discord: the advertised contract and the delivery.

Slack DM parity for Discord has three halves, and each one is a separate way to
ship a tool that looks right and delivers nothing:

* the ADVERTISEMENT -- the ``session`` enum, the argument validator that runs
  before the handler (a value the enum offers and the validator rejects is
  advertised and unreachable), and a description that says what the value does;
* the TOOL -- which transport the ``channels`` governance vet is asked about, and
  the refusal of Slack-only options that have no meaning off Slack;
* the ROUTE -- resolving the configured owner's DM through the channel-neutral
  transport contract, passing the same fail-closed egress gate an ordinary
  Discord message passes, and telling the caller which surface actually took the
  message.
