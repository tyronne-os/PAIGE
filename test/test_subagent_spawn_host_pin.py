"""A NEW test that spawns a subagent must not read the host's free memory.

``SubagentManager.spawn`` refuses -- returning before it registers anything in
``_tasks`` -- while the machine looks short of memory, and it does so twice: an
absolute floor (``check_memory_available`` against ``agent.spawn_min_memory_gb``)
and the posture tier (``cached_admission_check``, refusing while the
cgroup-clamped reading is CRITICAL). ``test/conftest.py``'s
``healthy_host_memory`` pins both, but only for a file that asks for it -- so
this is what stops the pinned set falling behind ``test/``.

A ratchet rather than a convention, because of how the failure reads: a refusal
IS a ``SubagentInfo`` -- a done one carrying ``error`` -- so
``assert info is not None`` still passes and the test dies on the NEXT line with
a bare ``KeyError`` naming an id nothing else mentions. Nothing in the traceback
says "memory"; the only evidence is a WARNING in the captured log. Measured on a
CI runner with ~0.5 GB free, on a PR that touched none of this.

Deliberately WIDER than the fixture acts on, the same way
``test_host_isolation_floor.py``'s ratchet is: a module that names
``SubagentManager`` AND calls ``.spawn(`` must be either pinned or excluded with
a reason, so adding one forces a decision instead of an omission. Files whose
``spawn`` is ``AcpRuntime.spawn`` never name ``SubagentManager`` and so are not
swept up -- that method has no memory gate.
