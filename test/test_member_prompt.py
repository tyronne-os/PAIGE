"""Crew Member system prompt: rules/briefing storage, injection, and routes.

Four-layer member identity block (see ``ContextBuilder._build_member_section``):

1. identity — derived from crew config, auto-generated
2. behavior — product-owned protocol constant
3. permanent rules — user-owned, under the keystone-gated ``trust/`` subtree
4. briefing — member-owned working memory, agent-writable, injection-capped

``KIROCREW_HOME`` is pinned per test by the autouse ``_isolate_kirocrew_home``
fixture, so every path here resolves under tmp.
