"""Fail-closed contract tests for the GitHub Release assembly step.

The release job has ``contents: write`` and is the final trust-boundary hop
before files become public.  These tests execute its actual shell step so an
unsigned fallback, a broad ``find | head`` selector, or a superficial presence
check cannot silently reappear.

Two platforms need that scrutiny, for the same structural reason: a release run
can hold more than one candidate file for them.  macOS must take only the gated,
notarized handoff and never the unsigned electron-builder output.  Windows must
take only the promoted bundle's installer on a promotion run and never the fresh
rebuild ``build-windows`` produces beside it.
