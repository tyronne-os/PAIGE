"""One cached read of the ``kiro_crew`` source tree, shared by every AST ratchet.

Several gates in this suite pin a structural property of the whole package by
walking ``src/kiro_crew/**/*.py`` and ``ast.parse``-ing each file. Independently
they each paid the same costs, and the suite paid them once per gate:

* the ``rglob`` walk and the read of ~41 MB of source (0.32 s), and
* a full ``ast.parse`` of all 1254 modules (2.8 s), even though a violation of
  any one gate can only exist in a file whose TEXT already contains the token
  that gate matches on.

So the corpus is read once here and cached, and each gate declares the literals
its pattern requires. :func:`parsed_candidates` parses only the files that can
possibly match, which is 10-22 files for the narrow gates and about a third of
the tree for the broad ones.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT do.

It does not cache parsed trees. Retaining all 1254 modules' ASTs measures at
~900 MB RSS and 3.2 M live nodes, which is per xdist worker, and it makes the
parse itself 4x slower (11.1 s vs 2.3 s) because every later generational
collection then traverses that live set -- a tax the whole rest of the session
pays. Trees are therefore yielded and dropped.

And it never narrows a gate. A literal is only accepted as a filter when the
gate's AST pattern cannot match without that literal appearing in the source
text, so filtering removes files that were always going to be non-matches.
Exclusions (``_vendor``, ``testing/``) stay in the calling gate, because which
files a gate polices is that gate's contract, not this module's.
