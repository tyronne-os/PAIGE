"""A channel-born transcript row carries a durable delivery identity (#5981).

The dashboard's merge keys on ``meta.mid`` and nothing else: ``isRedeliveredMessage``
drops a redelivered row by it, ``olderHeadAbovePage`` cuts the retained scrollback
head at it, and ``rowIdentities``/``tailNotInPage`` decide by it which prior rows a
page already carries. Every one of those DECLINES rather than guesses when the id is
absent or has changed -- so a row whose identity is not stable degrades all three at
once, and the same reply can render more than once in the dashboard's view.

Channel dispatchers persisted their rows with no ``mid``, so the row reached disk
with no ``meta``; each surface that materialized it
(``channel_slots._rebuild_window`` / ``refresh_channel_window``) then minted a FRESH
id, giving one logical row a different identity on every pass. The dispatcher is the
first and only place the row exists -- a channel turn runs on its own session, so
unlike the dashboard dual-writers there is no ``_ChatSlot.append`` to mint the id and
hand it back -- so it now mints its own.

Discord's ``mirrored`` branch is the one exception and is pinned separately below: it
DOES have a slot, so it must thread that slot's id into the durable write rather than
mint a second one. ``append_if_absent`` skips only a body-equal row carrying the SAME
mid, so an unrelated id can never match the copy the slot save landed and the turn
would be persisted twice -- a durable duplicate, worse than the display one this
change fixes.

Structured after ``test_channel_persist_agent_metadata.py`` (#2890, the same "every
channel omitted a kwarg on its persist writes" shape): the unbound ``_persist_turn``
is called with a minimal stand-in so no channel client has to be constructed.
