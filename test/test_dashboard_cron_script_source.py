"""Tests for GET /api/crons/{id}/script (api_cron_script_source).

The endpoint renders a script cron's source read-only in the dashboard. The
security contract under test: the file path is derived exclusively from the
job's own stored ``script`` field (the job id is the only client input), the
read is contained to ``<config_dir>/crons/`` through the nolink chokepoint, a
path that resolves outside that root is refused with a 4xx (never a 500), and
the response is size-capped rather than streaming an unbounded file.
