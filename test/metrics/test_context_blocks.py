"""Attribution closure + correctness for kiro_crew.context_blocks.split_blocks.

split_blocks classifies the FINAL assembled prompt by the bracket markers the
context assembly already emits, so the breakdown is read from what was actually
sent rather than counted at ~30 append sites. The load-bearing property is
closure: every character is attributed exactly once, which is what lets a reader
trust the per-block sizes. These drive the real function over realistic prompt
shapes rather than restating its arithmetic.
