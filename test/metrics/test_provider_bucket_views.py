"""Guards for the per-instrument histogram bucket Views.

Context: bucket boundaries used to be ONE shared array applied through a single
catch-all ``View(instrument_type=Histogram)``. Its top bound was 60s, sized for
session startup, so the first ``kirocrew.turn.duration`` sample ever recorded
(227589ms) fell into the +Inf overflow bucket and the aggregator reported
``p50 == p90 == 60000`` — a ceiling artifact rendered as a real latency.

The fix replaces the catch-all with one View per instrument. That makes two
properties load-bearing, and both are asserted here:

1. **Completeness.** With no catch-all, an instrument missing from
   ``_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS_MS`` silently falls back to OTEL's default 10s-ceiling
   boundaries. ``test_every_source_histogram_has_bounds`` fails when a histogram
   metric name appears in the source with no map entry.
2. **No duplicate streams.** The OTEL SDK applies EVERY matching View, not the
   first, so re-introducing a catch-all would publish each named instrument
   twice under one metric name. ``test_no_duplicate_streams_per_instrument``
   pins that.

    The naming scan above can only recognise a histogram by a ``.duration``

    ``kirocrew.embed.inference`` are millisecond histograms with no such suffix,
    and a non-duration histogram (``kirocrew.turn.credits``) has no reason to
    carry one — all three were therefore invisible to the old guard and inherited
    OTEL's default 10s-ceiling buckets in silence.

    So this walks every module for a call to ``histogram`` and reads its first
    argument (a string literal, or a module-level ``str`` constant resolved by
    name, which is how the turn family spells its instruments) together with its
    ``unit=`` keyword. Finding instruments by SHAPE is what makes the guard hold
    for a histogram nobody remembered to name in a regex, and reading the unit is
    what lets the two bucket maps be checked against what they actually claim
