"""End-to-end verification that telemetry actually reaches an exporter.

``test_local_exporter.py`` already proves that serialization works, but it proves
it of the exporter alone: it constructs a ``JsonlMetricExporter`` directly, feeds
it from a provider assembled in the test, and asserts valid JSONL, shard
lifecycle, and resource-level identity. What no test covered is the same question
asked of the LIVE BUILD -- that the roster ``provider._build_recorder()`` actually
registers arrives, carrying the attribute values the modules declare, at the
temporality each instrument kind requires. That gap is real: an instrument can be
missing, and an attribute value or a temporality setting can be correct in the
SDK's in-memory view and still be wrong, dropped, or unencodable by the time it
leaves the process. These tests close it by driving that live path and reading
what an exporter actually received.

Two tiers, because the OTLP exporter is an optional extra
(``pip install "kirocrew[otlp]"``) that a default dev/CI environment does not
have:

* **Tier 1 — serialization (always runs).** The live build's own JSONL exporter
  writes real records to disk. Asserts the full instrument roster arrives, that
  resource attributes survive with fidelity, that attribute values are the closed
  enums the modules declare, and that temporality is what each instrument kind
  requires.
* **Tier 2 — OTLP wire (skipped without the extra).** A real
  ``OTLPMetricExporter`` posts to an in-process HTTP receiver bound to loopback,
  whose protobuf body is decoded and asserted. No container, no downloaded
  binary, and no egress off the machine, so it runs anywhere the extra is
  installed.

A third tier — a genuine ``otel-collector`` process — is deliberately NOT here: it
needs a downloaded binary and outbound network, so it cannot run in a
network-isolated CI. ``docs/guides/telemetry-otlp-export.md`` describes how to do
that check by hand against whichever collector you actually run.

    The claim is about OUR builder: it passes its own DELTA map only when the
    operator has NOT set the variable, so a host that names a preference keeps
    the exporter's own handling of it — which is what lets an operator match a
    backend that requires CUMULATIVE (CloudWatch, Prometheus-style) or DELTA
    (Datadog, Statsig) without a code change, and what the guide documents.

    The CUMULATIVE direction is the one that needs a test rather than a comment:
    the exporter applies an explicitly passed dict ON TOP of whichever base the
    variable chose, so passing the map unconditionally would silently override
    exactly the operator who asked for the OTel default.
