"""Tests for ``platform_compat.host_available_mib`` on all three platforms.

This reading is what stops a full test run from swapping the developer's machine:
the xdist worker budget divides it by a per-worker reservation to decide how many
workers to spawn. Its failure mode is silent and one-directional -- ``0`` means
"unknown", an unknown reading is SKIPPED rather than treated as zero memory, and
the run then proceeds at the unbounded ceiling with nothing in the log. So a
platform whose branch is missing does not report a conservative number; it reports
no number, and the budget it feeds becomes an identity function.

That is exactly what happened while the reading was ``/proc/meminfo`` only, and
no test could catch it because one asserted the zero. The class that matters most
here is therefore :class:`TestEveryPlatformProducesAReading`, which fails if any
platform's branch stops answering.

macOS and Windows cannot execute on the Linux fleet, so both are driven through
their own C entry point: a fake ``libSystem`` injected over ``ctypes.CDLL`` for
Mach, and a stubbed ``system_memory`` for ``GlobalMemoryStatusEx``.
