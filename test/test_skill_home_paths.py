"""Guard: skill guidance must point at the CURRENT data home, not the legacy one.

The data home moved from a top-level ``~/.kirocrew`` to ``~/.kiro/crew`` (nested
under kiro-cli's ``~/.kiro``). Skill files were missed by that move, so agents
following them ran commands against a path that no longer exists -- and the
scripts some skills execute (``prepare-pr``'s ``$SKILL_DIR/scripts/*.py``,
``self-nudge-loop``'s ``.local_secret`` read, ``feature-demo-recording``'s venv)
failed outright.

These tests keep the fix from silently regressing: a skill that reintroduces the
legacy home fails here rather than at an agent's runtime.

Deliberately NOT covered: production modules (e.g.
``apps/builtins/file_explorer/server.py``) reference the legacy home on purpose,
to migrate it and to keep detecting it. Only skill files are asserted.
