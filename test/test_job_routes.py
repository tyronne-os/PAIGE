"""Coverage tests for kiro_crew.apps.job_routes — the shared ``_jobs/*`` HTTP
surface mounted once for every app.

Everything runs in-process against ``aiohttp``'s ``TestServer`` with
``KIROCREW_HOME`` pointed at ``tmp_path`` and the guards monkeypatched — no
network, no subprocess. The routes resolve the app from the URL and look its
:class:`JobSDK` up in a process-global registry, so a fixture forgets the SDK
on teardown to keep tests from leaking into the rest of the suite.

The two guards the handler consults are patched on their ORIGINATING modules,
because the module imports them lazily inside the request:
``is_owner_dashboard_request`` / ``_owner_denial_response`` on the dashboard
handler modules, and ``_is_restricted_session`` on ``_shared`` — patching a
copy on ``job_routes`` would never be reached. ``is_app_enabled`` is imported
at ``job_routes`` module scope, so it is patched there.
