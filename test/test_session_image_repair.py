"""Tests for repairing kiro-cli transcripts wedged by an oversized image.

The module rewrites stored image blocks in a ``.jsonl`` transcript so no image
exceeds the inline-image edge cap. These tests generate REAL PNG bytes with
Pillow (the fixtures must decode), build records at both observed nesting depths
(a ``Prompt`` attachment directly under ``content`` and a ``ToolResults`` image
one ``toolResult`` level deeper), and assert the structural invariants a repair
must preserve. Pillow is a hard dependency here, as it is in the neighbouring
``test_web_verify_downscale`` / ``test_image_primitives`` suites, so it is
imported at module level with no skipif guard.
