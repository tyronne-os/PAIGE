"""POST /api/chat/slots files a new slot into its folder BEFORE announcing it.

The bug these pin: ``get_or_create_slot`` broadcasts the whole slot list while
still inside the create handler, i.e. before the HTTP response reaches the
browser. So a folder applied *after* creation (the old client-side
``setSlotFolder`` PATCH) could never win the race — the dashboard received a
slots frame for an unfiled slot, rendered the new session at the top level, and
only ~200ms later moved it into the folder. Measured in a real browser: the new
row's first paint was at root every time.

The fix is ordering, so the tests assert ordering: the create handler wraps its
whole set-up in ``suspend_slots_push()``, which means exactly ONE coalesced
``slots`` broadcast is emitted and it already carries ``folder_id``. Asserting
only the final state would pass even with the race reintroduced.
