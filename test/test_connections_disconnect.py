gone. Every assertion here is about that gap or about telling the truth when the
removal only partly succeeds.

Boundary these tests also pin: the artifacts are stat-ed and unlinked, never
opened, so no token material can enter the process.

    entry from ``<agents>/kirocrew.json`` too (``_remove_from_agent_file``), and
    that file has a SECOND independent writer -- ``apps/bridges.py`` does
    whole-file read-modify-writes of it under ``bridges._mcp_lock``
    (``kirocrew.lock``). The MCP transaction lock the purge runs under is a
    DIFFERENT sidecar (``settings/mcp.lock``), so it excludes nothing here: an
    app registration that read the file before the strip and wrote it back after
    resurrects the purged entry -- and Disconnect has by then deleted the grant,
    leaving a configured provider with a dead credential. It does not self-heal,
    because ``rebuild_agent_config`` uses the existing rendered file as its merge
    base and only reconciles ``app:server`` keys under that lock.

    So the read AND the write must sit inside the file's own lock. Held from this
    thread, the strip must WAIT; pre-fix it completes straight through.
