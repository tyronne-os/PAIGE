"""``computer_use.capture_windows`` — the blank-frame gate and the capture floors.

Runs on every platform: the decision functions here are pure over a byte buffer,
and the two that are not are driven through fakes, so no window is captured and no
native library loads.

This module shipped with NO direct test, which is why a review found four defects
in it at once. The one that mattered is pinned first: :func:`_has_content` is the
ONLY thing standing between a swapchain window that reports a successful capture
and a blank rectangle relayed to the model as though it were the application.
``PrintWindow`` returns success while producing a uniform buffer, so the return
value carries no information at all.

Three later cases carry more weight than the rest, because each was a defect that
no test could see and no code reading would reveal:

* the capture must not fall back to ``BitBlt``, which reads the SCREEN and so can
  put an unauthorized application's pixels in a frame labelled as the target's;
* the buffer must be 32bpp, because ``PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT`` renders through DWM
  and writes NOTHING into a 24bpp one while still returning 1;
* the buffer must be sized to what the window RENDERS, not to its DPI-aware rect,
  because ``PrintWindow`` draws in the target's own coordinate space.
