"""Tests for the generic pending-context drain + the thread->session persist map.

Ported from the upstream project — but ONLY the generic half. The
headline Slack thread-backfill (``_backfill_thread_context``) fires exclusively
on the challenge-and-redirect auto-link flow, which this fork DELIBERATELY
removes (external Slack messages reach the agent inline; there is no
``send_channel_challenge`` / ``_CHALLENGE_REDIRECT_ENABLED`` gate). So the
backfill helper, its ``chat_slack`` imports, and the auth/security/guard test
classes are dropped. What remains is the ungated refactor:

* ``chat_runner.drain_pending_context`` — the shared drain contract every
  producer (app-kit context inject) feeds; pinned here by driving a plain
  entry through it directly (not via the absent backfill helper).
* ``session_map`` thread->session reverse index survives a reload.
