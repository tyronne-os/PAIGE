    ``send_json(error)`` -> ``ws.close()`` -> ``_emit_end_audit(...)``, so
    ``receive_json()`` returns on the error frame while the handler still has two
    steps to go. Exiting the ``TestClient`` context is not a barrier either: it
    closes the client side and does not await the server handler's coroutine to
    completion. Asserting on ``calls`` right after either point is therefore a
    race that fails whenever the event loop happens not to resume the handler
    first — reproduced at roughly 1-in-8 locally and seen intermittently on CI.
