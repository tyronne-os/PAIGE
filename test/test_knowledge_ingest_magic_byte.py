"""Regression tests for the content-signature gate on ``/api/knowledge/ingest``.

CWE-434: the ingest handler derives the file type from the attacker-controlled
multipart filename extension, and ``FileReader.read()`` dispatches to a binary
parser (.pdf -> pdfplumber, .docx -> python-docx) purely by that extension. A
file whose bytes don't match its claimed extension (e.g. an HTML/script payload
named ``x.pdf``) must be rejected with HTTP 400 BEFORE it reaches the parser --
mirroring the sibling ``api_upload_file`` magic-byte gate. Genuine text formats
(.md/.txt/.html) have no reliable signature and still ingest.
