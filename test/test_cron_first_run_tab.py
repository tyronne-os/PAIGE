"""Tests for the first-run cron tab pre-create (ensure_cron_slot, issue #8336).

The result injection used to be the ONLY creator site for a ``cron-{job.id}``
dashboard slot, and it runs after a turn completes — so during a brand-new
job's FIRST run the tab did not exist. Session-control caller identity walks
the live slot table (``caller_slot_key``), so every verb a first run called
refused with ``caller_unidentified``; the dashboard-surface registry had the
same first-run hole. These tests pin the pre-create path and the invariant the
issue named explicitly: the hydration must MOVE with the link, so the
injection's unlink guard stays an idempotent no-op after a pre-create.

The state/job fakes mirror test_dashboard_cron_to_chat.py's, plus ``get_slot``
and ``has_slot`` defined as REAL functions over the same dict: on a bare
MagicMock both auto-return truthy mocks, which would silently satisfy the
short-circuit under test and make every assertion here unable to fail.
