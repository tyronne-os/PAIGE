"""A safety-override grant dropped by a restart must not vanish silently.

Grants live in memory, so a restart ends them -- that is the design and these
tests do not challenge it. What they pin is the NOTICE: a timed grant that still
had time left when the process went down is reported to the operator once, and
the three cases that owe no notice stay quiet.

The whole surface is a pure function of a small file plus the wall clock, so no
restart is simulated: writing the record and then reading it back through
``take_dropped_grant`` IS the restart, from the reader's point of view.
