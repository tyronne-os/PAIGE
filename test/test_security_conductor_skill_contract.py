"""The security-conductor skill's contract, pinned against its own text.

The skill body IS the operating procedure -- it is what a conductor session is
seeded with, and the sibling scripts are written against clauses it states. A
well-meaning rewrite of a markdown file can drop the clause a script's exit codes
mean something under, or the clause that bounds a worker's aggression, and nothing
anywhere goes red. This file closes that.

The assertions are about SUBSTANCE, not sentences, and the dividing line is stated
so a later edit has a rule to follow: assert a phrase when it states a RULE -- an
obligation, a prohibition, a defined behaviour, a name a script shares -- and do
NOT assert one that only explains WHY the rule exists. Rationale is what a rewrite
is entitled to reword; pinning it produces a typo detector that every legitimate
edit has to fight, which is the failure mode that makes text tests get deleted.

The rules-of-engagement export gets its own class. It is the M0 review surface, so
its SHAPE (schema tag, the six rule fields, a reason on every rule) is a contract a
human reviewer and ``scope_check.py`` both read -- and an export missing a field
reads as "nothing to say about that" rather than as an omission.
