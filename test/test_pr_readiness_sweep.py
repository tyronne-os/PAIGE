"""Behavioural tests for .github/workflows/pr-readiness-sweep.yml.

The sweep's entire decision logic lives in one `run:` block of shell + jq that no
other test touches. These tests extract that script and execute it for real with
`gh` replaced by a stub, so the re-fire CONDITIONS are verified rather than
assumed -- and the condition is the whole point: too narrow and a frozen verdict
stays frozen, too broad and every genuinely-failing PR gets dispatched every 15
minutes forever.

Skipped where the POSIX toolchain the script needs (bash, jq, GNU `date -d`) is
unavailable, which is the case on the Windows leg of the matrix. Mirrors the
explicit nt guard in test_issue_triage_workflow.py.
