"""Contract tests for the stateless ``ask_question`` MCP tool (issue #755).

``ask_question`` no longer resolves a user-scoped token or blocks on a
server-side HTTP round-trip. It VALIDATES its arguments and returns a session
DIRECTIVE — a human confirmation plus an opaque marker carrying the validated
questions (and NO session key). The session-aware consumer
(``dashboard.chat_runner._run_chat``'s ``EVENT_TOOL_RESULT`` handler) decodes the
marker and, via ``dashboard.session_directive_apply.apply_session_directive``,
posts a NON-BLOCKING question card to ITS OWN slot; the agent then ends its turn
and the user's answer arrives as an ordinary next message.

The tests split along that seam:

* **Tool contract** — call the tool via ``_call_tool_inner`` and assert the
  returned directive decodes to the validated questions on a default install,
  and that a non-dashboard session gets a plain ``[OPTIONS:]`` steer (NO
  directive).
* **Applier** — call ``apply_session_directive(..., "ask_question", ...)`` with
  a fake state exposing ``post_question_card`` and assert the card is posted to
  the slot's key, that the confirmation tells the model to END its turn, and
  that a no-client post steers the model to ask in plain text instead.

The former mock-dashboard HTTP server, the ``_post_user`` user-token handshake,
the socket-timeout margin, and the answered/timeout/error round-trip tests are
gone: that logic no longer exists — the tool is stateless and the card is posted
in-process by the applier.
