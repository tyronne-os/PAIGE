"""Tests for surfacing the provider's TRUE error text.

kiro-cli wraps every mid-stream provider failure in one envelope::

    Encountered an error in the response stream: <the real cause>

``_RE_5XX_HINT`` used to match the literal ``response stream``, i.e. the
ENVELOPE rather than anything about the failure inside it. Because the 5xx
branch sits near the end of the if/elif chain, that made it a catch-all: every
provider failure without an earlier curated branch was rewritten to "The model
backend hit a transient error (HTTP 5xx) ... retry in a moment", the real cause
was discarded, and ``_is_transient_raw_error`` agreed it was retryable so the
turn burned the whole retry ladder first.

Reported case: a monthly-usage-limit rejection. The terminal CLI printed "The
monthly usage limit has been reached" while the dashboard, for the same class of
error, claimed a momentary 5xx and told the user to retry — which can never
succeed until the allowance resets.

Two changes are pinned here:

1. The envelope is no longer a transient token, and unrecognised failures show
   the provider's own text (CLI parity) instead of a ``repr`` of the JSON-RPC
   dict.
2. Usage-limit exhaustion is a first-class TERMINAL branch, so it is never
   retried and says so.
