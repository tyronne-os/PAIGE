"""Guards the committed macOS ``.icns`` bundles against malformed small slots.

electron-builder's own PNG->icns converter writes the legacy ``icp4`` / ``icp5``
slots (16pt / 32pt @1x) with PNG payloads. macOS decodes those two slots as raw
ARGB, so every small-icon consumer — Spotlight rows, Finder list views, and
third-party app pickers such as Logi Options+ — renders the compressed bytes as
colored static instead of the icon, while 128px-and-up surfaces look correct.

The fix is to ship .icns files produced by Apple's ``iconutil``
(``packaging/make-icns.sh``), which emits ``ic04`` / ``ic05`` for those sizes,
and point ``mac.icon`` at them. This suite is the regression gate: it fails if
someone regenerates the icons with a converter that reintroduces
``icp4``/``icp5``, or points ``mac.icon`` back at a PNG (which hands icns
generation to electron-builder again). Pure byte parsing — no macOS-only tools,
so it runs on Linux CI too.
