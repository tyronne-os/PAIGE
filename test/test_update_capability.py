"""One derivation of install shape → update capability, and its anchoring.

The detection this module replaces was ``os.path.exists(".git")`` in three
places. That accepted any ``.git`` entry, and — worse for anything that then runs
``git reset`` — a check anchored only by exit status accepts a directory whose
ANCESTOR is a repository. A venv nested in a project tree, or a home directory
that is itself a dotfiles repo, would classify as a git install.
