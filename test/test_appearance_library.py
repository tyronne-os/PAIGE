"""The crew appearance library: its own store, its own routes.

Crews wear appearance packs from a library the dashboard owns. It is a SEPARATE
library from Crew Companion's -- that app is independent and keeps its own packs
under its own data directory behind its own enabled-gated routes -- so the two
share only the pack format and the ``AppearanceStore`` class.

These tests hold:

* the crew store is rooted at the data home and never at the Companion's dir;
* the dashboard routes work with the Companion app disabled or absent;
* every route is owner-gated, and the audit never decides the request;
* untrusted SVG is served inert;
* deleting a pack a crew still wears is refused, by name, unless forced.
