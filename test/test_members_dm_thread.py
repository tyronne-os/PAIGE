"""Crew Members DM threads: binding persistence, routes, and pin enforcement.

Covers spec task 2 of the Crew Members page:

* ``dm.json`` binding read/write in the existing per-member space
  (``$KIROCREW_HOME/members/<slug>/``, isolated per test by the autouse
  ``_isolate_kirocrew_home`` fixture).
* Route contract for ``GET /api/members`` and the idempotent
  ``POST /api/members/{slug}/thread``.
* Agent-pin enforcement at every reachable writer: the send-path slot config,
  the agent-switch endpoint, and the mid-turn ``EVENT_AGENT_SWITCHED`` veto.
  Each denial test also asserts the slot state did NOT move (the mutation
  check: removing the guard makes these fail by letting the write land).
