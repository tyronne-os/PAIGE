"""The computer-use gate after the governance removal (``computer_use/gate.py``).

This file used to be ~1650 lines pinning eight governance scopes, an
unattended-surface refusal, an interactive-approval floor and an observation
ceiling. All of that is gone by product decision: computer use is ONE operator
opt-in, and after that the agent drives the desktop the way the operator would.

What is left to pin is small but worth pinning, because each item is a place where
a future edit could quietly reintroduce a refusal (or lose the audit):

* the gate PERMITS — including on surfaces that used to be refused outright
  (cron, subagent, taskrunner), which is the behaviour change users will actually
  notice;
* every call is AUDITED, since with the ceiling gone the SEL trail is the
  operator's only record of what the agent did to their desktop;
* the observation ceiling is a pass-through, so a renderer cannot lose fields to
  it;
* the one retained refusal (KiroCrew's own window) lives in ``policy``, NOT here —
  asserted so nobody moves it back into the gate.
