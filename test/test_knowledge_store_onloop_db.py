"""Off-loop DB discipline for the knowledge store (#7078, remedy A of #3057).

``scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py`` rejects a blocking DB call written
*lexically* inside an ``async def``. It cannot see the same call one frame down:
an ``async def`` that calls a plain synchronous store method which runs the
query. That interprocedural half is what this guard closes, by checking at the
one accessor every query funnels through -- ``KnowledgeStore.db``.

These tests pin the discipline from four directions:

1. the runtime chokepoint itself (strict raise / production warn / off-loop
   no-op / throttled warning),
2. the *interprocedural* catch, together with proof that the static gate is
   blind to the very same call -- the two are complementary, not redundant,
3. the deliberate departure from ``history.py``: ``KIROCREW_DEV_MODE`` alone
   must NOT arm this store's raise while #7019's 85 recorded on-loop callers
   are outstanding,
4. a mutation guard, so deleting the check from the accessor fails loudly
   instead of silently disarming everything above.
