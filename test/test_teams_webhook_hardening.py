"""The self-authenticating webhooks' CSRF exemption, and Teams route hardening.

``POST /api/messaging/teams`` and ``POST /api/hooks/agent`` are the two routes in
the product an unauthenticated external caller can reach. The Bot Framework
Connector posts to the first from Microsoft's servers holding nothing but a JWT;
CI runners, review bots and deploy pipelines post to the second holding nothing
but a webhook bearer token. Three things make that safe, and each is pinned here
because none of them is visible from the handler:

1. **The CSRF Origin check is skipped for the TEAMS path, POST only.** The Bot
   Framework Connector is server-to-server and sends neither ``Origin`` nor
   ``Referer``, and ``check_origin`` accepts a header-less request only from a
   loopback peer — so without the exemption the route 403s in the topology that
   exposes the gateway directly, before its own credential is ever examined. The
   set is defined once (``token_auth.CSRF_EXEMPT_EXACT_METHODS``) and read by the
   single middleware factory both entrypoints build from, so it cannot be granted
   on one server and withheld on the other. `/api/hooks/agent` shares the shape and
   has the TOKEN bypass, but is deliberately NOT Origin-exempt: no reported failure
   named it, and a perimeter exemption is harder to withdraw than to add.
2. **The method scope is load-bearing, and on the hook path it closes a live
   collision.** The literal ``agent`` also matches the ``{hook_id}`` wildcard of
   the PUT/DELETE ``/api/hooks/{hook_id}`` CRUD routes, whose handler
   authenticates by dashboard token alone, so an unscoped entry would strip the
   CSRF barrier off those two methods as well.
3. **The Teams route throttles failed auth and caps the body** before delegating,
   so an anonymous flood cannot buy an unbounded buffer per request. Note the
   throttle's own scope: it is SKIPPED for a proxied request (see
   ``is_proxied_request``), which is normal in two of the three documented
   topologies, so it is not what bounds the JWKS refetch -- that damper lives next
   to the refetch in ``JwtValidator._get_signing_key`` and is pinned in
   ``test_teams_client.py``. The hook route's own equivalent
   (``webhooks.auth_throttle``) is covered by ``test_webhooks_auth_surface.py``.
