"""One renderer for the agent roster, shared by all three surfaces that show it.

Three surfaces put installed agent names in front of a model: an unknown-agent
refusal (``subagent._available_agents_hint``), the spawn tools' parameter
descriptions (``spawn._agent_roster_hint``), and ``spawn_list``'s output. Each
one used to re-implement the same pipeline -- grammar filter, redact, bound,
report the remainder -- and the copies had already drifted apart.

``subagent.visible_agent_names`` is now that pipeline. These tests pin its
contract, ratchet that no surface re-implements it, and hold each of the three
rendered strings byte-for-byte at what it was before the extraction.
