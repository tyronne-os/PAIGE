    Steps 1 and 2 of the resolver walk EVERY ancestor of the fake package dir,

    ``.venv/bin/kirocrew``) on that walk, and it wins over the launcher the test
    built because step 1 runs to the filesystem root before step 2 starts.
    Patching ``os.path.isfile`` does not close that door: the validator asks
    ``Path.is_file`` and ``os.access``. Confining the validator itself makes the
    resolver's answer a function of the tree the test built, wherever pytest put
    it. Real validation still runs inside that tree, so a test that expects a

        ``KIROCREW_APPROVAL_MODE`` is read straight out of os.environ by
        mcp_tools/spawn.py and forwarded as ``approval_mode`` on every
        ``spawn_run`` subagent launch. If an agent-writable agent.json could
        seed it onto kirocrew-core's env, a clean rebuild would hand every
        subagent auto-approval — a full PreToolUse-gate bypass. The other
        session-identity/secret keys are stripped for the same reason: none
        of them is something agent.json should ever be able to set.

        The interpreter/loader names are asserted alongside them because they
        reach the same outcome one layer earlier: a managed server is a Python
        entry point, so a ``PYTHONPATH`` here lets a ``sitecustomize`` module run
        during interpreter startup -- inside the process holding the internal API
        secret, with no tool call for the gate to intercept.

        The strip is ``env.sanitize_spec_env``, so the property under test is
        the one a name list cannot state: two whole NAMESPACES, ``KIROCREW_``
        and ``PYTHON``, are refused by PREFIX and case-INSENSITIVELY.
        ``KIROCREW_CLI`` is asserted because ``mcp_cron._caller_is_cli()`` reads
        it as "skip per-session ownership entirely";
        ``PYTHONBREAKPOINT`` because it takes a dotted callable and imports it;
        ``KIROCREW_NOT_YET_INVENTED`` and ``PYTHONNOTYETINVENTED`` stand for the
        next variable in each namespace that nobody has added yet, which is the
        case an enumeration structurally cannot cover. The odd-cased spellings
        matter on Windows, where environment names are case-insensitive so
        ``Kirocrew_Approval_Mode`` reaches the consumer exactly like the
        upper-cased name.
