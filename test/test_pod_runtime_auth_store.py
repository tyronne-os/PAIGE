"""The pod stages the agent runtime's OWN identity store, not just the SSO cache.

`test_the_agent_runtime_auth_stores_stay_visible` in the sandbox-mask suite pins
`.local/share/kiro-cli` and `.local/share/amazon-q` out of every masking tier
because "the agent runtime is itself spawned inside this sandbox and resolves its
own access token from that store". Not masking it is only half the requirement:
under the pod's remapped ``HOME`` the store must also EXIST there. Staging only
`.aws/sso/cache` left the pod's child at kiro-cli's login gate with a readable,
correctly-unmasked corridor -- the cache is not where the token is resolved.

    Fact 3 is why the finding's "mask it from tool subprocesses only" cannot be
    implemented as stated: Crew wraps the HARNESS, and the harness spawns its tool
    subprocesses inside that wrapper, so the two audiences share one namespace and

        This test previously asserted a PARITY -- the staged store uncovered "like
        ``KIROCREW_HOME``" while the real ``$HOME`` stayed covered by a surviving
        literal regex. #9183 ("split security.py into a package and drop path
        regex") deleted the fence-literal and relative-traversal matchers outright,
        so that framing is obsolete and the third assertion it made is now false.

        What is left is simpler and worth pinning as such: the command matcher
        allows every path spelling, the real home's own credential files included,
        so the pod tree is not a special case and no parity claim applies. The
        assertion runs in BOTH directions -- the resolving gate still refuses each
        of these -- so a future round that reinstates a text-layer path matcher, or
        loses the resolving fence, fails here rather than drifting quietly.
