"""Tests for :mod:`kiro_crew.skill_trust` -- the project-skills consent record.

A ``SKILL.md`` is prose that enters the agent's context and can instruct it to
run anything, so loading one out of whatever repository the operator happened to
clone is an execution-adjacent decision. This module is the gate on that
decision, which makes every property below a security property rather than a
convenience: each test therefore says WHY it matters, not just what it checks.

Isolation: ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is pinned to this test's ``tmp_path`` (the same
lever the rootdir conftest uses) and ``config.paths._resolved_home`` is reset
with it, because ``config_dir()`` memoises the resolved home in a module global
for the process lifetime and one xdist worker runs thousands of tests in one
process. The module also memoises the enforcement read against a stat
signature, so ``reset_cache_for_tests()`` runs around every test and after any
store write a test performs by hand.
