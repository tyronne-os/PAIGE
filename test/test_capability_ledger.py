"""The capability ledger: every TransportCapabilities field is classified.

``TransportCapabilities`` drifted into being false documentation: flags were
declared, docstrings described gates, and nothing read most of the fields.
Measured 2026-08-02: 7 of 9 flags had ZERO read sites, five channel
declarations were provably wrong against their own code, and one docstring
promised a ``max_buttons`` degradation no renderer implements.

This module is the ratchet against that recurring. Two rules:

1. Every field is either ENFORCED (something behaves differently) or
   ASPIRATIONAL (declared honestly, consumed by nothing yet). Adding a field
   without classifying it here fails the mirror test.
2. A field moving from ASPIRATIONAL to ENFORCED must move sets here in the
   same change, so the ledger stays the map of what a declaration actually
   buys.

The declaration pins below assert the CORRECTED values, with each correction's
reason inline — they are honesty regressions, not tautologies.

    # The same limit in UTF-8 BYTES, preferred over the char count by
    # messaging.renderer.chunk_for_transport, which both cross-surface mirror
    # legs (dashboard/chat_runner.py, slack/gateway.py's subagent reply ladder)

    # construction: a byte-capped transport that declares it gets fence-aware
    # byte splitting, and one that does not keeps the 4x-pessimistic char floor.
    "max_message_bytes",

    # target (``accepts_inbound``) in dashboard/chat_mirror.py, and therefore
    # whether the slot row reports ``direction: both``. Only a transport whose
    # inbound path resolves the mirror binding may declare it.

    # TOTAL interactive choices per [OPTIONS:] prompt. Widget-capable
    # renderers (slack/discord/telegram) route the parsed list through
    # messaging.renderer.apply_options_cap / cap_choices; overflow degrades
    # to a numbered text list instead of being silently dropped. Pinned per
    # channel by test_options_cap_contract.py. Channels declaring 0 render
    # no widget (trailer stripped; their text fallback is the
    # approval-ladder work).
    "max_buttons",
    # Gates whether a renderer extracts local image references out of a sealed
    # segment and uploads them (discord/renderer.py::_uploads_enabled ->
    # client.send_message_with_files). A channel declaring False keeps printing
    # the markdown path, which is the honest degradation -- never a silent drop.

    # boundary. ``table_mode`` selects off/cards/grid/native/auto and

    # Decides whether an EMPTY message id from ``send_message`` means "refused"

    # through messaging.transport.delivery_confirmed at all three proactive-send

    # directions -- a lost message reported as delivered, or a delivered cron
    # result reported as lost with its dedup hash left unadvanced, repeating the
    # same result every tick. Pinned against each transport's own send_message,
    # by AST and in both directions, in
    # test_channel_transport_outbound_authz.py::TestTheMessageIdConventionIsDeclared.

    # messaging.renderer.display_safe_for reads it at the channel-neutral proactive
    # sinks (dashboard/handlers/messaging.py) and applies the ZWSP defang only
    # where one exists -- Webex declares False because its allow-list IS email
    # addresses and the defang makes every address uncopyable.
    "mention_grammars",
    # Gates whether a renderer attaches an Adaptive Card at all
    # (webex/renderer.py::_options_card and ::on_prompt_choice). A channel
    # declaring False keeps the numbered-text and typed-reply forms, which work
