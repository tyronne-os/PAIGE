"""The tool_input security scan must not run on the asyncio event loop.

``_resolve_permission`` inspects EVERY string ``_extract_tool_input_strings``
pulls out of the parsed tool input — including whole document bodies, which are
scanned as shell commands. The three predicates
(``is_sensitive_path`` / ``is_sensitive_bash_command`` / ``is_denied``) are
regex-heavy, so one long newline-free line held the loop past the 25s watchdog
and killed the gateway (Mesh-3693). The scan now happens in ONE
``asyncio.to_thread`` hop for the whole loop.

These tests pin three contracts:

1. Equivalence — the decision AND the reason/mechanism reaching the SEL row are
   byte-identical to the pre-offload behaviour, for a denied path, a denied bash
   command, a benign payload, a nested structure, and an empty input.
2. Off-loop — the predicates run on a thread that is not the loop's when they
   are applied to tool_input strings (the title-tier checks above still run on
   the loop, so calls are matched by their argument).
3. Liveness — a concurrent asyncio task keeps ticking while a 20 KB
   newline-free non-shell document body is scanned.
