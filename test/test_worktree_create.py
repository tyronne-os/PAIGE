    """Regression guard for the loop-guard regression (RC run 33295704858).

    ``wrap_argv`` refuses to run on a running event loop, so every helper that
    reaches git through ``worktree._run_git`` must be awaited on a worker thread
    from an ``async def`` body — exactly as ``api_worktree_create`` does. When an
    async test called one directly, the guard's ``RuntimeError`` surfaced as
    ``SandboxUnavailable`` from inside the assertion, which is byte-identical to
    the "this host has no sandbox backend" refusal these tests legitimately
    assert. Worse, the shared ``_sandbox_exec_reason`` cache made the outcome
    depend on ordering: poisoned from the loop it SKIPPED every git test in the
    worker (green CI, no coverage), populated from a sync test it FAILED them.

    A static check, not a runtime one: the offending call has to execute to be
    caught otherwise, and the skip path is what hid it in the first place.
