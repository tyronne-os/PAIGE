"""Wire-level tests for the Microsoft Teams channel.

Runs the REAL TeamsClient against a fake aiohttp session. Teams is the most
worthwhile channel to test at this layer because its outbound path carries an
app bearer credential to a **server-supplied** URL (``serviceUrl`` arrives on
the inbound activity), so the request-construction code is a security boundary,
not just a serialization detail.

The credential exchange posts FORM-encoded data (``data={...}``), not JSON --
inspected via ``RecordedRequest.form``.
