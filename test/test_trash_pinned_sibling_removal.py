"""The two sibling trash-removal paths, and the primitive they now share.

Both paths reach a point where the batch holds nothing worth keeping and has to go.
Removing it by PATH re-resolves every ancestor, so a directory above the trash swapped
to a symbolic link -- by anything running as this user, which in this product includes
an agent -- is followed and the removal lands outside the trash entirely.

The swap is set up on disk rather than simulated, and the victim carries a file, so a
test that passes says the file survived rather than that a code path was taken.
