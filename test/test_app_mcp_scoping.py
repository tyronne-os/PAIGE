"""App MCP servers land in KiroCrew's agent config, never the shared kiro file.

The shared ``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`` is read by everything else under
``~/.kiro`` — Kiro IDE and any other kiro-cli agent — so registering an app's
MCP servers there leaked private app tools into surfaces that never installed
the app. These tests pin the fix: registration targets the agent config, the
shared file is left alone, and a ``clean`` rebuild re-derives app entries from
