"""The promise-only downgrade must cover EVERY auto-approve grant source (#2696).

The recovery arm injects a continuation that the model then acts on. That is only
safe while a human approves the resulting tool call, which is why the arm
downgrades to a notice when approval is gone: a detector false-accept then costs
a notice instead of an unrequested action.

Approval is granted by ``slot_trusted or yolo_active`` in the tool-event branch,
so gating the downgrade on yolo ALONE left every trusted-but-not-yolo session on
the auto-continue path with its approval gate already removed -- the exact state
the downgrade exists to refuse. Blocking finding from the #2696 GPT round,
anchored on the ``backend-security-controls`` AUTOSDE rule.

Both tests are here rather than in ``test_promise_only_recovery.py`` because that
file covers the pure detector and gating predicate; this defect lives at the CALL
SITE, inside the turn loop, where neither pure function can reach it. The second
test therefore derives the grant sources from the approval branch itself, so
adding a THIRD source fails this test until the downgrade learns about it too.
