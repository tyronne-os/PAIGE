"""Windows liveness-probe audit — ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` must never reach Windows.

On POSIX, ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` is the idiomatic "does this pid exist?" probe:
signal 0 performs the permission/existence check without delivering anything.
On Windows CPython maps ``os.kill(pid, sig)`` onto ``TerminateProcess(handle,
sig)`` for every signal except ``CTRL_C_EVENT``/``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` — so the
same expression **terminates the process it is asking about** (with exit code 0)
and then reports it alive. It is not a portability wart; it is a silent
process-killer, and the damage lands on whatever now owns that pid.

``platform_compat.pid_exists`` / ``pid_liveness`` exist precisely for this
(``OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)`` on Windows) and preserve the
POSIX semantics callers rely on, including "EPERM means alive, not gone".

This is a regression tripwire, in the spirit of ``test_spawn_audit.py``: a NEW
raw signal-0 probe fails this test until the author either routes it through the
shim or adds a ``file::function`` key to :data:`GATED_PROBES` with a
justification for why that site can never execute on Windows.

Scope is deliberately narrow — only the signal-0 *probe* form, not raw POSIX
calls in general. The tree carries many raw POSIX call sites (``fcntl``,
``resource``, ``os.killpg``, ``pty``, ``termios``, …) and the overwhelming
majority are legitimately POSIX-gated implementation detail; auditing them all
here would bury this signal in noise. General portability is governed by the
``platform_compat`` shim table in
``docs/system-specs/common/platform-compat.md``, the ``cross-platform.yml``
added-line gate, and review. What makes signal-0 special is that getting it
wrong is *destructive* rather than merely unavailable — and the CI gate only
inspects lines a PR adds, so a probe that arrives by a file move or a rebase is
invisible to it. This test reads the whole tree on every run.
