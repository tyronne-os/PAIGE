"""Requirement (Connections G2 pod-grant-isolation): if ``HOME`` is remapped
for ANY process, the real passwd home's sensitive paths (``~/.aws``,
``~/.ssh``, ``~/.kirocrew*``) must STILL be denied by ``security.py``'s
matchers inside that process. A remap that unfences the real home is a
rejected design.

Why this matters for the pod ``HOME`` remap
(``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap``): ``security.py``'s sensitive-path
matchers run inside the GATEWAY process, evaluating a tool call's ARGUMENTS
against the gateway's own ``Path.home()`` -- the spawned kiro-cli child's
remapped ``HOME`` never reaches this code, because the gateway process's
``os.environ["HOME"]`` is never touched by ``build_pod_env`` or by
``_apply_pod_home_remap`` (which mutates only the CHILD's env dict handed to
``create_subprocess_exec``/``create_subprocess_limited``, not the gateway's
own ``os.environ``).

These tests pin that property directly: a fenced path resolved against the
gateway's OWN home stays denied regardless of what ``HOME`` a spawned
child happens to run under.

    ``Path.home()`` resolves it.

    ``USERPROFILE`` is set alongside ``HOME`` because Windows ``Path.home()``
    reads that one and never ``HOME`` -- pinning only ``HOME`` leaves the
    matcher anchored on the real runner profile there, which is what made these
    tests fail on the Windows shard while passing on Linux. Mirrors the autouse
    fixture in ``test_pod.py``, which pins both for the same reason.

    **The HOME-derived target cache in ``security`` is reset**, and that is what
    makes a pinned home actually reach the gate rather than only the environment.
    ``_home_targets_cache`` is TTL-bounded and keyed on the resolved roots, so it
    does pick up a new home -- and it is the cache the rest of
    ``test_security.py`` already clears by hand, which is the established seam this
    follows.

    An earlier revision also reset ``_SENSITIVE_RE``, the fast-path regex global
    that ``is_sensitive_bash_command`` built once from ``Path.home()`` with no
    invalidation hook; a stale copy of it was what made these tests fail on the
    Windows shard alone. #9183 deleted that pass along with the whole path-matching
    layer, so there is no such global left to drop and the asymmetry it caused is
    gone with it.

    Nothing in production depends on the reset -- the gateway's own HOME does not
    move under it, and ``_apply_pod_home_remap`` changes only a CHILD's environment
    -- so this is a test-pinning helper, not a gate fix.

    Also creates the directory, so ``resolve()`` is well defined on every platform,

# The Windows-native bash-tokenization class that used to close this file was
# removed when this branch rebased over #9089 ("move the path fence to the layer
# that can hold it"). It pinned the bash-text normalizer second pass
# (``_windows_native_path_tokens`` / ``_check_sensitive_via_normalizer`` /
# ``_win_anchor_roots``), and #9089 deleted that whole leg on the stated grounds
# that a path fenced only in command TEXT is still readable through an ``open()``
# that never routes through the tool gate. ``test_security.py``'s
# ``TestTraversalSimulationIsGone`` now asserts those helpers are ABSENT by name.
#
# The pod grant store's fence is therefore carried by the two layers #9089 keeps,
# both of which this file still pins above: ``is_sensitive_path`` on every
# resolved path (``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` re-anchors every ``home_dirs`` entry in
# ``security._home_dir_targets_uncached``), and the OS mask
# (``sandbox._pod_os_home_targets``), covered by
# ``test_sandbox_pod_grant_corridor.py``.
