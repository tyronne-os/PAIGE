"""Tests for the dependency-only sync that stands in for a blocked reinstall.

The module exists because Windows cannot rewrite a running console script, so
these tests pin what the substitution rests on: it is shaped as PARITY with
``pip install -e .`` rather than as an improvement on it (same order, same scope,
extras left alone), it never hands the project itself to pip, it applies the two
gates a dependency-only install cannot inherit from pip (the interpreter floor and
a repointed console script), and it refuses to write to a venv that serves a
different checkout.
