"""Security-conductor agent installer.

Mirrors ``test_pipeline_conductor_agent.py``'s installer half: stub the agents
dir and ``build_agent_config``, run the installer, assert on the JSON it wrote.
There is no script half here — the ``security-conductor`` skill and its bundled
scripts land separately, and this module deliberately asserts only that the
prompt NAMES them, since a spec that shipped without the reference would leave
the agent deciding scope and acceptance by judgment.
