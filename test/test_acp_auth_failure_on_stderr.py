"""kiro-cli auth failures on stderr must be classified as auth, not as a timeout.

Two auth classifiers had drifted apart by call path. The JSON-RPC error-frame path
reached the full vocabulary (`_is_session_expired` plus `_RE_AUTH`). The spawn /
`session/new` path had its own detector matching one literal banner, `not logged in`.

Real expired-token output does not use that wording -- it reports
`AccessDeniedException: "Invalid token"` and `the bearer token included in the
request is invalid` -- so the spawn path discarded an auth signal the codebase
could already read, and the operator saw `Request session/new timed out after 90s`.
That is not a cosmetic message problem: `AcpAuthRequired` is explicitly
non-retryable, so failing to reach it burns the whole retry ladder and the full
timeout budget per attempt on a credential no retry can fix.

The stderr corpus below is real kiro-cli output captured during an actual token
expiry, not invented wording.

The first two tests deliberately assert through `AcpRuntime.saw_not_logged_in()`
rather than through the new helper. That predicate exists in both the fixed and
the unfixed tree, so on unfixed code these fail with an AssertionError showing the
real defect -- not with an ImportError showing only that a new function is absent.
