    -200 dBFS -- the epsilon in `_frame_db`, not a level. Seeding the floor from it
    put every later frame 130 dB above the floor, so room tone cleared the speech
    margin and the utterance could never end: measured at 1282 of 1500 room-tone
    frames before the fix. Clamping the seed to `ABSOLUTE_SILENCE_DB` is not enough
    either -- that still seeds BELOW a real room, and the slow rise coefficient took
    ~170 frames to converge -- so an unset floor stays unset until a frame carries a
    real level.
