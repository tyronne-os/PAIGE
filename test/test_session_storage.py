"""Tests for session storage measurement and the trash/restore cycle.

Both stores are addressed through their real resolvers by pointing
``KIROCREW_HOME`` and ``KIRO_HOME`` at temp directories, rather than patching the
module's bound names, so the tests exercise the same path resolution the product
uses and a change to where either store lives fails here.

The invariant these tests exist to protect: a session's halves are always
reclaimed and restored TOGETHER. Half a session is worse than either extreme — it
either lists without resuming, or resumes without history.
