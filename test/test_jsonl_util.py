"""Tests for the shared JSONL rotation helper (``jsonl_util.rotate_jsonl_at``).

The helper owns ONLY the rotate-by-rename step its call sites share (the MCP
stub's fallback log, the subagents' slow-command log, member activity logs);
each site keeps its own append and error contract. These tests pin the
helper's contract directly; the per-site behavior stays pinned by each site's
own rotation tests.

        """An over-cap record must be refused even when it is assembled ACROSS reads.

        Written for a real escape: the cap was once judged only on the leftover
        buffer after a read, and a record could slip past it entirely. A
        full-length chunk containing a CARRIAGE RETURN splits into a piece plus a
        tail, that tail could sit exactly at cap and so survive the buffer check,
        and the next read then supplied more body AND the terminator at once --
        yielding a record of nearly twice the cap, whole.

        HOW it is prevented has since changed, and this docstring says so rather
        than implying a mechanism that is no longer the active one. Each read is
        now bounded by what the carried record has left, so the buffer cannot
        reach that size in the first place and this input is refused by the
        unterminated-tail check. The per-piece body check still exists and is
        still reachable -- a record whose body is one byte over the cap and whose
        terminator arrives in the same read hits it -- and it is pinned by
        `test_record_one_byte_over_cap_is_skipped`, not by this test. Verified by
        mutation: disabling the per-piece check leaves THIS test green and fails
        that one.

        Kept because it pins the OUTCOME for a shape that once escaped, which is
        what a regression test is for, and it would catch a future change that
        relaxed the read bound back.

        A chunk full of such records is the cheap way to trigger it on an
        agent-writable file, so this pins the COST, not just the output.

        Asserted on the reader's SCAN TRACE, not on a clock, and that choice is
        the third correction in this test's history. The first version asserted
        an absolute ceiling (1.0s for 200,000 records) and went red on a slower
        CI machine. The second asserted a wall-clock ratio between two sizes,
        which cancels machine speed -- and still flaked twice: once on Windows
        clock quantisation (one scheduler tick against three reads as exactly
        3.00x), and once on a shared runner where a single noisy doubled sample
        (0.319s against a 0.101s base) read as 3.15x with no quadratic work in
        sight (#8606). Best-of-3 `process_time` sampling and a measured-quantum
        floor were already in place for that second flake; a clock on a shared
        runner is noise all the way down. Per the AGENTS.md testing convention
        (assert shape, not duration; pin the linear path deterministically
        where the code has structure to observe), this now observes the work
        itself.

        The structure observed: `_frames` walks each buffered chunk by OFFSET,
        issuing exactly one `_BOUNDARY_RE.search(buf, start)` per record with a
        strictly advancing `start`, and slices the remainder once per chunk.
        Both quadratic forms this test exists to catch break that trace shape
        deterministically through this seam:

        - Re-slicing the buffer per record hands every search a FRESH object
          with `start` 0, so its per-buffer traces are single-call and the
          start-at-0 count -- constant for the offset walk -- goes per-record,
          which the zero-start bound catches.
        - Replacing the single regex scan with one `bytes.find` per terminator
          (quadratic on a file with no `\\n` until the end) abandons this seam
          entirely, so the trace goes empty and the hits-per-record assertion
          fails.

        Cost added OFF the seam -- say, copying the tail once per record while
        still searching the original buffer by offset -- is invisible to any
        trace, so a generous absolute `process_time` budget at the small
        doubled size backstops a catastrophic blowup, per the testing
        convention's "keep a small-n absolute assertion alongside". Unlike the
        ratio it replaces, the budget carries two orders of magnitude of
        headroom, so neither a slow shared runner nor coverage tracing can
        cross it.

        The doubling assertion is exact, not a ratio with headroom: doubling
        the record count must exactly double the number of boundary searches
        (the cap here is far above the chunk size, so per-record search counts
        cannot depend on where chunk boundaries fall). Integer counts have no
        noise to leave headroom for.
