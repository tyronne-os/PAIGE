"""``capabilities.social_share`` — the switch that withdraws "Share as image".

The share card is rendered and exported in the browser; its egress is the intent
buttons, which hand the reply's caption to X / LinkedIn in a URL. There is no
server-side share action to refuse, so the control is the dashboard entry and the
only place the dashboard can learn the ceiling's answer is
``GET /api/dashboard/config`` (``social_share_enabled``). These tests pin:

* :class:`TestScopeCatalog` — adding the scope is a DATA change: one row.
* :class:`TestProbe` — the probe through the REAL evaluator: ungoverned and
  policy-silent hosts permit; a policy pin denies; a PROFILE bound to the
  dashboard surface denies too (every layer is honoured — this is a per-request
  dashboard question, not a startup probe); an unevaluable ceiling denies
  (fail-closed); the surface key is the pinned dashboard one, never a caller value.
* :class:`TestDashboardConfigEndpoint` — the GET reports the answer, EVERY
  decision leaves a ``governance_decision`` SEL row, and the PUT tolerates the
  round-tripped read-only field without persisting it.
* :class:`TestGovernanceGenerationFrame` — the WS ``slots`` frame carries the
  ceiling generation the client invalidates ``dashboardConfig`` on.
