"""Regression tests for kiro-safe MCP server-key aliasing.

kiro-cli resolves agent ``tools``/``allowedTools`` entries (``@server``) by
splitting on ``/``, so a server key containing ``/`` (e.g. the npm-scoped
``npm:@playwright/mcp``) can never be referenced as ``@key`` -- kiro reads the
trailing path segment as a tool name and exposes none of the server's tools.
These tests lock the slash-free aliasing + migration that fixes it.
