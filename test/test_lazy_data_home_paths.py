"""Guard: data-home paths must never be resolved at import time.

Issue #874. ``config_dir()``, ``kiro_sessions_dir()`` and friends read
``KIROCREW_HOME`` on *every* call. Binding one of them to a module-level constant
freezes whichever home happened to be active when that module was first
imported, which silently breaks:

* **pod isolation** -- a pod exports its own ``KIROCREW_HOME``;
* **the lazy default-home resolution** (``~/.kiro/crew``), which is deliberately
  resolved late and cached;
* **test isolation** -- the autouse ``_isolate_kirocrew_home`` fixture in
  ``conftest.py`` runs *after* collection has already imported the module under
  test, so it cannot reach a frozen constant. That hole is how a local test run
  wrote 2128 fixture rows and 362 fixture cron records into an operator's real
  data home.

The failure mode is silent: no error, no warning, plausible-looking behaviour,
with the damage only surfacing later as fabricated numbers in an aggregation.
A reviewer cannot be expected to catch the 17th occurrence by eye, so this is
enforced structurally instead.

The fix pattern (see ``dashboard/handlers/usage.py`` for the reference, and
``instances/registry.py`` / ``sel.py`` / ``history.py`` for prior art)::

    _SOME_DIR: Path | None = None          # explicit override hook, None = live

    def _some_dir() -> Path:
        return _SOME_DIR if _SOME_DIR is not None else config_dir() / "some"

Keeping the module-level name means existing ``monkeypatch.setattr(mod,
"_SOME_DIR", tmp)`` call sites keep working unchanged.
