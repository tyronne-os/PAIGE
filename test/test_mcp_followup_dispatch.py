"""Direct coverage for the stateless ``suggest_followup`` MCP path (#755).

The dispatch branch in ``_call_tool_inner`` no longer resolves session
identity, no longer refuses non-dashboard sessions, and no longer POSTs to the
gateway. It VALIDATES its items and returns a session DIRECTIVE (see
``kiro_crew.session_directive``). The session-aware consumer renders the card
against ITS OWN slot via
``kiro_crew.dashboard.session_directive_apply.apply_session_directive`` — that
applier is exercised directly here against a fake state whose
``deliver_ws_owners`` returns a delivered-client count.
