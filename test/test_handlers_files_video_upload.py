"""Tests for video uploads through ``api_upload_file`` (POST /api/upload/file).

Video is the one accepted type that does NOT take the in-memory route: the part
streams to disk chunk by chunk under its own, much larger ceiling, because a
screen recording is routinely bigger than the whole document cap and cannot be
buffered. That makes three properties worth pinning, none of which the existing
upload suite covers:

* the container signature is still checked BEFORE any byte is written, so an
  allowed extension cannot smuggle arbitrary content (CWE-434), and a refused
  upload leaves nothing behind on disk;
* the document cap does not apply to video, and the video cap does;
* the accepted set is narrower than what ``<video>`` will attempt — ``.mkv``
  shares WebM's signature but stays rejected on purpose.
