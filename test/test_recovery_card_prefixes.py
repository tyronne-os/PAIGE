"""Cross-language drift guard for the chat transcript's recovery rows.

Every synthetic continuation the runner injects is rendered by
``website/src/pages/chat/RecoveryCard.tsx``, which classifies a row by matching
the bracketed marker line at the top of the injected prompt. The two sides are
in different languages with no shared build step, so a new marker added on the
Python side is invisible to the card and its machine-facing prose falls through
to a full-width chat bubble -- the regression this module exists to catch.

The assertions are deliberately source-level: they compare the constants in
``state.py`` against the literal prefix table in the TSX rather than exercising
a render, because the failure mode is a MISSING table entry, which no render of
the existing kinds can reveal.
