"""Consent must precede any billable AWS request.

Three properties, one per step of the fix:

1. The voice-reply provider default is the LOCAL one, so enabling voice reply
   without naming a provider cannot reach a paid AWS service.
2. Every gated call site refuses when there is no matching grant, and the grant
   record lives on the keystone floor where the agent cannot mint it.
3. The credential source is named (an empty profile is NOT "no account"), and a
   grant recorded for one account does not survive the profile being repointed
   at another.
