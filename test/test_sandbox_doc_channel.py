"""The document channel that artifact and widget frames load from.

These frames render HTML the model wrote. The channel exists because a ``blob:``
URL is refused outright by some WebKit-based in-app browsers, so the bytes are
served as a real document instead — which means the dashboard's own origin now
has a URL that returns model-authored HTML. What keeps that safe is asserted
here, not assumed:

* the path token is the credential, and it is bound to the requesting client
* every invalid condition fails closed as 404, so the route is not an oracle
* ``Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`` travels on the response, so the document
  has an opaque origin even when opened top-level rather than in a frame
* the stash is bounded, so a long session cannot grow it without limit
