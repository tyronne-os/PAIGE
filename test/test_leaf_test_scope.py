"""Pin the leaf-test reduction: every escalation fires, and CI calls the script.

The reduction this guards replaces the sharded backend suite with a small set for
a diff that only MODIFIES leaf test modules. That is safe only while each
escalation below holds, so each is asserted directly rather than trusted from the
script's own self-test -- and the self-test is additionally executed here, so
`--test` rotting is a test failure rather than a silent no-op.

Two of these tests exist because a reviewer found the hole: `test_workflows_presence`
reaches the `test/` tree via `Path(__file__).resolve().parent` + `.glob(...)` and was
missed by the first version's `/ "test"` regex, and five files reach a test module
through `importlib.import_module`, which no import-statement pattern sees.
