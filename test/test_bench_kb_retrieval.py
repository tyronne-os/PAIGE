"""Tests for the Knowledge Library retrieval eval harness (``bench kb-retrieval``).

Covers the pure metric (``mrr_at_k``), the golden-set model's refusals, the
end-to-end deterministic run against a real ``KnowledgeStore`` + ``HybridRetriever``
via the toy embedder, per-class and abstention scoring, cross-process determinism,
and the CLI dispatch (toy path + the --real-embedder refusal when the model is
absent).
