"""Tests pinning the off-loop offload of the ACP spawn filesystem work.

The spawn prelude performs synchronous filesystem syscalls whose latency
scales with the ``/tmp`` entry count (``_resolve_ssh_auth_sock`` globs
``/tmp/ssh-*/agent.*`` + stats each match; ``resolve_krb5_ccname`` lstat/stats
``/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>``) plus a ``mkdir`` of the work dir. None of these may run
on the asyncio event loop: a blocking call there stalls every other task,
including the watchdog heartbeat. These tests pin four contracts:

1. ``AcpClient._spawn`` runs both env resolvers and the work-dir mkdir on a
   non-loop thread (one bundled thread hop for the resolvers).
2. ``AcpClient.ensure_ready`` — which runs before EVERY prompt — performs at
   most ONE mkdir, on the first call per instance and off-loop; every later
   call performs none. (``_spawn`` also creates the dir, and ``_reset_state``
   clears the process and session id together, so every session-init path
   re-enters ``_spawn`` first.)
3. ``AcpRuntime.spawn`` runs its mkdir and ``resolve_krb5_ccname`` on a
   non-loop thread.
4. ``AcpClient._spawn`` runs the PID-file tracking writes (``_track_pid``,
   ``_track_session_pid``) on a non-loop thread — each takes an exclusive
   file lock and writes under it, so an on-loop call serializes concurrent
   spawns behind the lock with the waiter holding the loop.
