"""Turn wall-clock (``elapsed_ms``) recorded by the webhook hooks surface.

The acp provider never assigns ``TurnUsage.duration_ms`` (it stays 0), so
``_run_hook_inner`` measures the turn locally and passes ``elapsed_ms`` to
``persist_token_record_async``, which records ``duration_ms`` = the provider
value when non-zero ELSE ``elapsed_ms``.

Both tests drive the real persist path and capture the built record at
``_write_token_record``, so the fallback (local clock fills a 0-duration turn)
and its precedence (a provider-reported duration still wins) are exercised end
to end — the negative control is what keeps the positive assertion honest.
