"""Tests for the security-posture detail registry (``security_posture``).

The registry exists because Settings → Security used to render hardcoded counts
that had silently gone stale by 2-3x. These tests pin the two properties that
make that regression structurally impossible:

1. **Derivation** — every ``count`` is ``len(items)``, and the items come from the
   LIVE control (``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``, ``BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES``,
   ``SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS``, the validation schemas). A control that grows
   without its posture entry growing fails here.
2. **Disclosure** — the payload carries public control definitions and derived
   counts only: no credential material, no governance rule contents, no user data.

#: Gate-side log/audit sites still reading the BASELINE redactor, counted per

#: NOT:
#:
#: * NOT a to-do list. For a site in a process that never composes a companion the
#:   baseline is the honest answer, not a defect — ``mcp_gateway/backend.py`` is
#:   exactly that case (``gatewayd`` never runs ``boot_platform``, which
#:   ``mcp_gateway/app_call.py`` relies on for its security ceiling), and
#:   converting it would trade every backend diagnostic for a per-line lazy
#:   resolution on the event loop.
#: * NOT a list of approved exceptions. No entry here has been ruled correct. The
#:   only claim these numbers make is "this many were here when the gate went up".
#: * NOT the egress axis. ``NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES`` and ``_REDACTION_SINKS``
#:   decide whether a module is an output boundary; that decision says nothing
#:   about WHICH redactor spelling a site uses, which is why all three sites #7151
#:   converged sat correctly bucketed for years while reading the weaker pass.
#:
#: What the gate buys: a NEW gate-side log line cannot be born on the baseline
#: silently. Growth in any module — or a first site in a module absent from here —
#: fails, and clearing it means either calling ``redact_log_via_context`` or
#: raising the number and saying which PROCESS the site runs in and why the
#: baseline is right there, to the standard that helper's docstring sets.
#:
#: Two limits, stated so nobody reads more into a green run: counts do not pin
#: identity, so converting one site while adding another inside the SAME module
#: nets to zero (both edits land in one reviewed diff), and the scan is
#: single-scope (see :func:`_gate_side_baseline_log_sites`).
