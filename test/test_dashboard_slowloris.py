"""Regression tests for the slowloris / CWE-400 read-timeout mitigation.

Covers the connection-level guard in ``kiro_crew.dashboard.slowloris`` and its
wiring into the dashboard / API server start paths:

- a connection that dribbles the request line/headers without ever completing
  them is force-closed after ``header_read_timeout`` (the slowloris vector);
- a well-formed request is served normally and its keep-alive connection is not
  spuriously reaped after the (one-shot, pre-handler) deadline elapses;
- ``build_hardened_runner`` actually wires the hardened server + timeouts;
- both ``start_dashboard`` and ``start_api_server`` use it.
