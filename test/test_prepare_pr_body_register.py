"""The PR body has to read as plain language, and the rule has to stay anchored.

`prepare-pr` writes the PR description, and its "What changed" section is what a
reviewer reads first. Left unconstrained it grows into layered clauses and
decorative jargon that hide the actual change. The skill now pins that prose to
the Age 5 row of the `explain-for` skill (Age 10 was tried first and still let
dense prose through).

Two joints can break silently. The register rule can be dropped from
`prepare-pr` (bodies drift back to dense prose with no test failing), or the
`explain-for` row it points at can be renamed away (the reference still reads
fine but resolves to nothing). One assertion each.
