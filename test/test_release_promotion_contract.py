"""Structural contracts for stable releases, in both of their modes.

The executable manifest tests prove digest and archive handling. These tests
pin the GitHub Actions wiring for the two ways a bare stable tag can ship:

* REBUILD (the default) builds fresh from the cleared commit on the stable
  channel, so the shipped bytes carry a bare ``X.Y.Z``.
* PROMOTE (opt in per version via the ``STABLE_PROMOTE_BYTES`` repo variable)
  republishes the soaked candidate's exact bytes, so stable runs the identical
  binary insiders validated -- at the cost of shipping that candidate's
  ``-insider.N`` / ``rcN`` stamp, which nothing downstream can re-stamp.

Rebuild is the default because the version a stable user sees must not carry a
prerelease suffix, and promotion can never deliver that. The modes are mutually
exclusive and every downstream "promotion or fresh?" choice reads
``promote_mode``, never ``channel``, so neither mode can half-apply and leave
one lane disagreeing with the rest of the release.
