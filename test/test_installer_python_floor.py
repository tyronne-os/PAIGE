"""The >= 3.12 floor must not turn a supported host or an upgrade into a dead end.

Raising ``requires-python`` is only half a floor bump. Every host-facing entry point
carries its OWN copy of two decisions -- "is this interpreter good enough" and "is
this venv still reusable" -- and each one fails differently when it is missed:

* A probe that ends in ``die``/``exit`` turns a host that used to install into one
  that aborts. Under the old >= 3.10 floor the distro's own ``python3`` satisfied
  every probe on Ubuntu 22.04, so the package-manager branch was always sufficient;
  under >= 3.12 it is not.
* A venv reused on its executability alone makes ``pip install -e .`` refuse the
  package ("Requires-Python >=3.12"), so a documented ``git pull && bash install.sh``
  upgrade dead-ends with no way forward.

The table these tests enforce, one row per entry point:

===================== ============= ======================== ==================
entry point           floor-gated?  provisions when missing  venv reuse gated
===================== ============= ======================== ==================
``install.sh``        yes           ``_bootstrap_python``    yes
``setup.sh``          yes           ``ensure-python.sh``     yes
``cloud-install.sh``  yes           ``ensure-python.sh``     yes
``cli.sh``            yes           ``uv``                   by construction
``ensure-python.sh``  yes           ``mise``                 n/a
``install.ps1``       yes           winget / choco 3.12      n/a (no venv)
``Makefile``          yes           ``ensure-python.sh``     yes
``make.ps1``          yes           advises (dev build)      yes
``minimal_install``   yes           advises (documented)     n/a
===================== ============= ======================== ==================

The last two advise rather than provision on purpose: ``make.ps1`` is the developer
build path and offers ``-Py <path>`` instead, and ``minimal_install.sh`` declares
"Prerequisites: Python 3.12+" as its contract.

These tests pin each decision at the source, because none is reachable from a unit
test on this host: the shell paths need a distro whose archive lacks python3.12, and
the reuse paths need a pre-3.12 venv.
