# Meetings (builtin app)

An AI meeting assistant. Transcribes a live meeting through Kiro Crew's own
streaming speech-to-text, stores the finalized transcript, fans each line out to
a small crew of background agents (structured notes, an HTML/Mermaid diagram, an
action-item list), and gates the meeting's close behind a review of the extracted
action items.

`defaultEnabled: false` — it appears in the App Store and is opt-in.

## Routes

Registered on the gateway's OWN aiohttp Application by
`backend/routes/__init__.py:register_routes` (the manifest names the same entry
point for the generic App Kit loader). Base path `/api/apps/meetings` — the
same-origin convention issue-radar and code-review-sage use, **not** the
`/apps/{name}/api` reverse proxy, because this app has no child process.

```

Every handler is wrapped by `_common.route`, which applies the enable gate and
turns validation failures into 4xx. `_common.error_response` maps an exception's
status to a LITERAL `web.json_response(..., status=NNN)` per branch — repetitive on
purpose, because the error-code contract scanner reads `status=exc.status` as
`dynamic_status` and cannot prove the contract is met. **A status with no branch
falls through to 400**, which was a live bug before the import route needed 403:
`store.contain` raises `MeetingsPathError(status=403)` for a path escaping the data
root, and that was reported as "bad request". A containment violation reported as
400 reads like a typo the caller can fix by retrying.

The two transcript PRODUCERS — `…/dispatch` and `…/import` — share
`_common.dispatch_line`: the live-session check, the transcript append, and the
synchronous queue fan-out as ONE transaction under the dispatch-admission lock,
plus the expiry branch's SIDE EFFECTS (close admission, drain the queues, mark the
meeting ended on disk). Shared rather than copied because a second copy of that
transaction is a second thing that has to stay correct — and because a producer
that skipped it would reopen the stop-versus-append race the lock closes.

## Data

All under `app_data_dir("meetings")` (`~/.kiro/crew/apps/meetings/data/`):

```
config.json                      app config (agents, providers, presets)
dictionary.toml                  speech-correction terms
calendar-cache.json              last calendar sync
task-ledger.json                 tasks filed through the local task provider
meetings/<safe_id>/session.json  per-meeting metadata
meetings/<safe_id>/tasks.json    extracted action items
meetings/<safe_id>/transcript.jsonl finalized speech + typed broadcasts
meetings/<safe_id>/<agent>.md    a markdown agent's output
meetings/<safe_id>/<agent>.html  an HTML agent's output
meetings/<safe_id>/translations.json  live translation, reset on language change
edits/<safe_id>/<agent>.md        the user's edit of that agent's minutes (sidecar)
```

`edits/` is an **app-owned sidecar root outside every agent-writable meeting
directory**, never a rewrite of the agent's file. It is registered on the shared
sensitive-path floor, so agent file tools cannot read an owner's unredacted text
or overwrite it with `fs_write`; the backend opens it directly. A user edit takes
precedence when outputs are read, so the agent's next rewrite cannot destroy the
user's correction, the correction cannot destroy the agent's work, and reverting
(`DELETE …/outputs`) is a file delete rather than a restore. The cost is that while
an edit exists the user stops seeing what the agent writes, so the outputs response
carries a `stale` flag per edit, derived by comparing the sidecar's mtime against
the generated file's — no second piece of state to drift out of true. Only a
markdown agent's output is editable
(`constants.EDITABLE_WIDGET_TYPE`; an HTML agent answers `409`), and the same
predicate gates the write **and** the read overlay, so a sidecar saved while an
agent was markdown is not served once its `widget_type` becomes html — at which
point the user's text would be handed to the iframe renderer. The sidecar's
filename is derived from the agent's validated id, never from the request, and
the directory passes through `store.contain` like every other derived path.

Deleting a meeting removes its complete per-meeting directory (metadata,
transcript, tasks, notes, and diagrams) and its app-owned edit directory. The route
refuses a meeting with a live
in-process session with `409 meeting_active`; the dashboard keeps the row's delete
affordance visible but disabled for active, paused, and reviewing states. Calendar
events are owned by their provider, so deleting local meeting data does not delete
the source event.
Deletion shares the task-mutation lock: an in-flight task edit completes before the
directory is removed, while a stale Quick Add after deletion returns
`404 meeting_not_found` instead of recreating an orphan `tasks.json`. The dashboard
also removes the meeting-scoped query cache, so reopening a retained calendar event
runs initialization again rather than displaying deleted local data. Initialization
and agent toggles share the lifecycle lock with deletion, so in-flight file creation
completes before the delete removes the directory and cannot recreate partial state.
Minutes edits share the metadata transaction with deletion as well: the meeting
existence check and sidecar write/delete are one unit, so a stale PUT cannot recreate
an orphan `edits/` directory. Deletion also waits for task filing's
provider-to-local-record transaction.

`ensure_data_dirs()` creates the subtree and seeds `dictionary.toml` +
`config.json` at app startup (an `on_startup` hook, run on the executor). It
never overwrites, so user edits survive every restart. A second `on_startup`
hook launches the calendar poller (below); its `on_cleanup` partner runs before
the session teardown hook, so no poll tick can pre-create a meeting mid-shutdown.

An alias matches a standalone occurrence, case-insensitively, longest alias first.
"Standalone" is asserted per edge: `\b` where the alias's own edge character is a
word character, and a lookaround for a neighbouring word character where it is
not. `\b` alone cannot express the second case — it asserts a word character on
exactly one side, so `\b\.net\b` demands one before the dot, skipping the
standalone ".net" and firing inside "asp.net" instead. Aliases like `c++`, `c#`
and `.net` are ordinary dictionary entries and have to match what was said.

Dictionary terms and aliases round-trip through UTF-8 TOML, including supplementary
Unicode characters. Quotes, backslashes, and control characters remain escaped;
the serializer does not emit JSON surrogate-pair escapes that TOML rejects.

Writing those characters literally means a term has to BE encodable, so `add_term`
refuses a code point in the surrogate range U+D800–U+DFFF — which a JSON request
body can spell (`{"correct": "\ud800"}`) but UTF-8 cannot represent. The refusal
sits next to the empty-term and length checks, BEFORE the process-wide dictionary
is replaced, so a term the file can never hold does not become the one live
transcript lines are corrected against. The route maps that `ValueError` to a 400
like any other invalid term.

## Lifecycle

```
idle ──start──> active ⇄ paused ──> reviewing ──> ended
                  │                    ▲             │
                  └────────────────────┘         restart
```

A meeting enters `idle` either when the dashboard opens its row (`POST …/init`)
or when the calendar poller pre-creates it ahead of its start; both run the same
idempotent init, so the two paths cannot produce two folders for one event.
Pre-creation never leaves `idle` — only a user's `start` does.

`reviewing` is a **gate, not a state to pass through**: `ended` is reachable only
from it, so no extracted action item is silently dropped. The UI's transition
table (`useMeetingSession.ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`) has a test asserting no other
state can reach `ended`.

`MAX_CONCURRENT_MEETINGS == 1`: a second `start` for a different meeting answers
409 while the first is live and unexpired. A session past
`MAX_SESSION_DURATION` (4h) answers 410 on dispatch.

## Agent dispatch

`domain/session.py`. One `AgentQueue` per enabled agent plus the always-on task
extractor. A queue batches lines and flushes every `BATCH_INTERVAL_SECS` (30s),
so an agent gets a paragraph of context rather than one interruption per
utterance. Three consecutive dispatch failures trip a circuit breaker (backoff
60s → 120s → stop); `POST …/reset` resumes.

`POST …/dispatch` first redacts and appends the finalized line to
`transcript.jsonl`, then fans it out to the queues. The response carries the same
stored record (`id`, UTC `timestamp`, `source`, `text`), so the dashboard can add
it to its React Query cache immediately while polling remains the reload and
disconnect recovery path. Polling sends the opaque byte cursor returned as
`next_cursor`; the initial request returns the complete history and later requests
read only appended bytes. `source` is `speech` for final STT segments and `typed`
for the broadcast bar; the `[chat]` agent-context prefix is not stored as user
text. Persist-before-fan-out is the data-integrity boundary: an accepted agent
line cannot be absent from the transcript. A 16 MiB per-meeting ceiling fails the
request with `413 transcript_too_large` before fan-out and never truncates an
accepted row. The browser treats that code as terminal instead of retrying: it
stops STT dispatch, disables typed broadcasts, and shows one persistent notice.
Appends are serialized, flushed, and synced. An append following a crash tail
first writes an accounted-for newline, so the malformed tail and the new valid
record cannot become one corrupt row; the reader skips malformed or invalid UTF-8
rows.

Dispatch admission has its own short lock covering the live-session check,
append, and synchronous queue fan-out. Lifecycle handlers wait for that
transaction, close admission where necessary, and release the lock before slow
agent flushes. Stop/review/delete therefore cannot detach agents mid-dispatch or
resurrect an orphan transcript directory, while a slow agent does not hold every
later speech request behind its flush.
Meetings created by an older version have no file and read as an empty transcript.

A flush takes **whole lines up to `MAX_BATCH_CHARS` (60k)** and deletes exactly
the lines it dispatched, so a queue that grew past the cap — a long pause, or a
backed-off agent resuming — carries its tail into the next flush. Truncating the
joined batch while clearing the whole queue silently DESTROYED transcript, whose
only symptom was notes that skip the end of what was said. A single line over the
cap is still truncated and consumed, because requeueing it would wedge the queue.
Pinned by `test_meetings_session.py::TestAgentQueue`.

Ending or pausing a meeting drains rather than interrupts. `flush_now` treats a
pending flush task by state: still SLEEPING on its interval, it is cancelled (that
is the point of flushing now); already inside `flush()` awaiting the agent, it is
AWAITED. Cancelling an in-flight dispatch killed the live turn, and because `busy`
was still set the follow-up flush then no-opped — so stopping a meeting mid-dispatch
lost that batch and the finalization notice, at the one moment a meeting's notes
matter most. `busy` is the discriminator. Pinned by
`::test_flush_now_waits_for_an_in_flight_dispatch` and
`::test_flush_now_still_cancels_a_sleeping_timer`.

**A drain is a loop, not one flush.** `flush()` deliberately sends exactly ONE
batch, so an over-cap queue needs several — and `flush()` cannot reschedule itself,
because it runs as the body of `_flush_task` and `_schedule_flush` takes its
"already running" early return from in there. Attempting the reschedule inline
scheduled nothing at all, which re-opened the very tail loss `_take_batch` closed.
The loop therefore lives in the two places that own the lifecycle: `_delayed_flush`
chains sleep→flush while `flush()` reports work remaining, and `flush_now` drains
before returning because teardown discards anything still queued. Both are bounded
by `_MAX_DRAIN_BATCHES`, and a flush that consumes nothing (a failing dispatch)
exits the loop instead of spinning — the circuit breaker still trips normally.
Pinned by `::test_flush_now_drains_every_queued_batch`,
`::test_the_batching_timer_chains_until_the_queue_is_empty`, and
`::test_a_failing_dispatch_does_not_spin_the_drain`.

**Teardown drains; only `set()` may cancel.** `ACTIVE.clear()` calls `cancel_all()`,
which drops the pending flush timers — so a session torn down with a half-batch
queued lost that transcript, and the final notes silently omitted whatever had not
been dispatched. Every teardown path now calls `await ACTIVE.drain_and_clear()`,
which flushes first: the expiry path (a long meeting whose next line arrives after
the session lapsed), gateway shutdown, `status=ENDED`, and `handle_stop_meeting` —
where it is load-bearing, because the finalize notice is itself enqueued and the old
cancel would have discarded the very notice just broadcast. A flush failure still
tears the session down, so a wedged agent cannot block shutdown. **Replacing a session is a teardown too.** `set()` cancels the outgoing session's
queues, so starting a second meeting while an earlier (typically expired) one still
held a half-batch discarded that transcript — the same loss by a different route.
`handle_start_meeting` therefore drains before it replaces. `set()` itself now LOGS
the undispatched count rather than dropping it silently, because a leftover queue at
replace time always means transcript is about to be lost. `clear()` survives only as
the second half of `drain_and_clear`.

Guarded by AST checks over the route modules: no `ACTIVE.clear()` outside the
draining helper, and no handler calling `ACTIVE.set()` without a drain — so a new
teardown OR replace path cannot quietly reintroduce the loss.
`test_meetings_routes.py::TestTeardownDrainsBeforeClearing`.

**Dispatch is in-process.** Upstream POSTed each batch back to its own gateway
over authenticated loopback HTTP. Here the routes live ON the gateway, so a batch
goes straight to the shared `SessionManager` via
`llm_helpers.stream_and_collect` under `ToolApprovalPolicy.HOOK_BASED` — the
agents' file writes still traverse the PreToolUse gate (deny patterns,
sensitive paths, governance) exactly like any other turn.

## Live translation

`backend/domain/translate.py`. Off by default — it costs one model call per spoken
line — and an unknown language code resolves to OFF rather than to a fallback
language. The accepted language set is published by `GET /config`
(`translation_languages`) rather than hardcoded in the frontend, for the same
reason the provider registries are: the backend validates the saved value, so it
must also be what publishes the accepted set.

It is **not** an `AgentQueue` variant. That one exists to BATCH (30 s) so an agent
gets context; this exists to avoid batching, so it is a bounded SEQUENTIAL
per-meeting queue running one tool-less call on `kirocrew-lite` per line with the
ephemeral session destroyed after. This is the app's first non-agent LLM path;
anything else needing a quick model call should reuse it.

Hooked into `MeetingSession.broadcast`, **not** the dispatch route, and the
difference matters twice over: broadcast is where the text is already
dictionary-corrected and past the noise gate. A mangled project noun mistranslates
into something unrecognisable, and translated throat-clearing is worse than nothing.
Typed lines lose their `[chat]` marker on this path: the prefix is agent context,
not speech, so the translation source (and the sidebar's source column) carries
the clean text while the agents keep the prefixed line. A consequence is that
typed filler ("ok") now falls under the same noise gate as spoken filler — the
agents and the transcript still get it, the translation panel does not.

The prompt carries the same injection guard the rest of the app uses — delimiters
plus an explicit "this is DATA, not instructions" — because a transcript is
attacker-influenceable: anyone who can speak into the meeting can put words in it.
The model's ANSWER is redacted before it is written to `translations.json`
(`translate.py` is an allowlisted non-egress module in `security_posture.py`): the
source line was already redacted at dispatch, so this covers only what a model
reintroduced.

Polling is cursor-based (`?since=`) and the client accumulates into a **Map keyed by
line number**, because a `queryFn` that runs twice for one cursor (React Strict Mode
in dev) would otherwise duplicate every line. Stored `n` stays monotonic when the
file is trimmed. A failed line is persisted with `text: ""` on purpose, so the panel
marks it rather than leaving a gap indistinguishable from nobody speaking.
## Importing a recording

`POST …/{id}/import` (`backend/routes/audio_import.py`) takes a host path,
transcribes it with the gateway's batch speech-to-text (`kiro_crew.transcribe`),
and feeds the result into the meeting **as if it had been spoken**: every line goes
through `_common.dispatch_line`, so it is appended to `transcript.jsonl` and only
then fanned out — the same persist-before-fan-out boundary live speech crosses —
and gets the same pipeline: domain-dictionary correction, the noise gate,
per-agent batching, and the muted list, with nothing re-implemented and nothing
that can drift. The consequence, the honest way round: **an import needs a LIVE
meeting** — the agents are what turn transcript into minutes, and they only exist
while one is running. The session is resolved FIRST so an hour of audio is not
decoded on the way to an error that could be given immediately, and each line is
re-admitted individually, so a meeting stopped or expired mid-import fails the
loop with the same 409/410 a spoken line would get instead of writing into a
torn-down meeting. The 16 MiB transcript ceiling applies per line exactly as it
does to speech: 413, with everything already dispatched staying dispatched.

`domain/audio.split_transcript` turns the one returned blob into lines in three
tiers: the transcriber's own segments when it gave any (a whisper segment is the
closest thing to one utterance), sentence boundaries when it returned a single
paragraph (AWS Transcribe does), and a hard wrap at `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS` —
wrapped rather than truncated, because truncating drops the tail of a long
sentence. `MAX_IMPORT_LINES` (2000) caps the fan-out — an overflow refuses the
entire import with a 413 rather than importing a truncated head, because a 200
that silently dropped the recording's tail is data loss. A recording file above
`MAX_IMPORT_AUDIO_BYTES` (512 MiB) is refused with a 413 before the decoder
runs — decoding materializes PCM for the whole file, so the size gate is the
only ceiling that fires while the memory cost is still zero. One import runs
per meeting at a time; a second concurrent request answers 409
(`import_in_progress`), because both would dispatch line-by-line into the same
transcript and interleave.

The path goes through `hooks.validate_file_path`, the shared dashboard file gate,
which canonicalizes (following symlinks) and enforces `is_sensitive_path`. The
predicate is never called directly, so this route's answer is identical to every
other file read in the product, and the extension check runs on the CANONICAL
path — a symlink named `.mp3` cannot smuggle in its target. `transcribe_audio`
re-checks the path itself, so a refusal is enforced twice by two owners. The
extension allowlist is a "did you mean this file" filter, not a content check.

`lines` and `dispatched` are reported separately: the gap is what the noise gate
dropped, and a recording that yields 400 lines of which 0 were dispatched (an
empty room, filler) is a real outcome the user must be able to see.

There is **no UI for this yet** — it is an API surface. A host-path picker in the
meeting view is a separate UI decision.

## The two provider seams

Both follow `kiro_crew.embeddings`' `EmbeddingBackend` /
`register_embedding_backend` shape: an ABC, a name-keyed factory registry, and a
resolver that **degrades instead of raising** on an unknown id. Each ships
exactly one real implementation; the seam exists so an out-of-repo edition can
register an organization's own provider without patching the app. Nothing in the
app branches on a provider name, and the settings UI is populated from the
registries, so a registered provider appears with no frontend change.

### Task provider (`backend/providers/tasks.py`)

`TaskProvider` (`provider_id`, `display_name`, `create(TaskDraft) -> TaskRef`).
Shipped: `local` — an app-scoped JSON ledger (`task-ledger.json`). `create` is
called on the subprocess executor, because an edition provider may talk to a
tracker over the network.

That executor makes `create` genuinely concurrent, so its read-append-write is
held under a **module-level** lock (`_LEDGER_LOCK`). The write is atomic; the
read-modify-write around it was not, so two parallel filings each read the same
list and the second write landed a snapshot missing the first — with both
requests reporting success. The lock is module level rather than per instance
because `get_task_provider` builds a fresh provider per request. Pinned by
`test_meetings_providers.py::TestLocalTaskProvider::test_concurrent_filings_do_not_overwrite_each_other`.

`TaskDraft.sanitized()` runs before anything leaves the process: an action item
is LLM output and a filed task is an external surface, so credential +
exfiltration-URL redaction and length caps are applied there.

Why not `task_models.Project`: the task runner's dataclasses model an autonomous
execution plan (ordered, dependency-linked, attempt counts, a state machine the
runner drives). A meeting action item is a durable human-owned to-do nobody
executes automatically; reusing `Project` would mean inventing a fake spec per
meeting and leaving the executor fields permanently unused.

### Calendar provider (`backend/providers/calendar.py`)

`CalendarProvider` (`provider_id`, `display_name`, `requires_source`,
`async fetch(days) -> [CalendarEvent]`). Shipped: `none` (the default — the app
is fully usable with ad-hoc meetings) and `ics`, a stdlib iCalendar reader fed by
a local `.ics` path or a published `https://` URL.

`parse_ics` reads only the `VEVENT` fields the app displays. Recurrence
(`RRULE`) is deliberately **not** expanded: a correct expansion needs a full RFC
5545 engine, and silently showing wrong occurrence times is worse than showing
only the series' first instance.

A whole-day `VALUE=DATE` event parses to the date's midnight UTC as a **date
anchor**, never dropped, and the event carries `all_day: true`. Classification
is by the body's shape (exactly eight digits), not the `VALUE` parameter, so a
date body whose parameter is missing, vendor-prefixed (`X-VALUE=DATE`), or
mislabeled (`VALUE=DATE-TIME`) is still kept and flagged — a parameter test
would drop those events, which the never-drop convention forbids. The dashboard
renders an all-day event as the calendar date alone — no time, and the date
fields read back in UTC rather than the browser's zone — because reading the
anchor as an instant shows the event on the previous day for every browser west
of UTC. The flag is set by the parser, where the value's form is still in hand:
a midnight timestamp alone cannot prove all-day-ness (a real 00:00 meeting is
not all-day), so any future provider parsing a date-without-time value must set
`all_day` the same way. For the same reason the flag cannot be recovered from a
cache written before it existed: `GET /calendar` normalizes a missing key to
`false` (keeping the wire type honest), and a legacy all-day row renders as a
timed event until the next sync rewrites the cache with real flags.

Fetch safety:

* an `https://` source is fetched with **aiohttp** (never `requests`/`urllib`,
  which would block the gateway's single event loop); the response is size-capped
  (4 MiB) while streaming, and a redirect off https is refused;
* only `https://` is accepted (`webcal://` is rewritten to it) — every other
  scheme, including `file://` and `http://`, is refused, so a config value cannot
  turn the sync into a local-file read or a plaintext hop;
* the resolved address is refused when it is loopback/private/link-local/
  reserved/multicast/unspecified — the gateway performs this fetch, so an
  internal-only address would make the endpoint a request-forgery hop. An IPv4
  address embedded in IPv6 (`::ffff:10.0.0.1` v4-mapped, `2002:…` 6to4) is judged
  by the address it embeds, since that is where the packet lands. Resolution is a
  blocking syscall, so the whole validation step runs on the executor;
* **the vetted address is the connected address.** `_normalize_url` returns a
  `VettedTarget` (url + host + port + approved addresses), and the fetch hands
  those addresses to a `_PinnedResolver` installed on the `TCPConnector`
  (`use_dns_cache=False`). Returning only the URL is what made the old gate a
  TOCTOU: aiohttp resolved the same name a second time for the connect, so a host
  whose DNS answer changed in between (short TTL, or a resolver alternating a
  public and a private record) passed validation and was then fetched at the
  private address — the `169.254.169.254` metadata shape. `calendar.source` is
  reachable from a dashboard `PUT /api/apps/meetings/config`, so this is
  request-supplied, not operator-only. Substituting the *resolution* step rather
  than rewriting the URL to an IP is deliberate: the request URL keeps its
  hostname, so the `Host` header, TLS SNI, and certificate verification stay
  correct. Verification is never disabled and `ssl=False` is never passed — a
  test asserts the connector keeps aiohttp's verified context
  (`CERT_REQUIRED`, `check_hostname`). An unpinned host is refused by the
  resolver rather than resolved, so the mechanism is fail-closed. Each redirect
  hop is re-validated **and** pinned before its own request, so no hop is
  vetted-then-re-resolved;
* a multi-record answer is **all-or-nothing**: every address must pass, and the
  whole set is pinned. A host answering with a mix of public and private
  addresses is refused outright rather than filtered down to the public ones —
  that mix is the rebinding signature, and keeping the public record would let an
  attacker retry until the connector picked the private one. Same rule for IPv4
  and IPv6;
* a local path is read on the executor, size-capped, and refused when
  `is_sensitive_path` matches.

### Background sync and pre-creation (`backend/calendar_poller.py`)

One asyncio task per gateway process, started with the app's `on_startup` hooks
(the same module-level-task shape as issue-radar's watcher). After a short
startup delay (`CALENDAR_POLL_STARTUP_DELAY_SECS`, so a calendar fetch is never
on the startup path) each tick:

1. skips entirely when the app is disabled (the same `is_app_enabled` the request
   gate reads), when `calendar.auto_sync` is off, or when the provider is `none`
   — the default install produces no fetch and no log line per tick;
2. otherwise runs `calendar_sync.sync_calendar`, the exact function behind
   `POST /calendar/sync`, so a scheduled sync and a manual one write the same
   cache and the same `meetings.calendar_sync` audit record;
3. then, for every cached **timed** event that starts within
   `calendar.precreate_lead_minutes` or has started and not yet ended, creates
   the meeting through `init_meeting_blocking` — the dashboard's own init — on a
   worker thread under `START_LOCK`, and audits `meetings.calendar_precreate` for
   each meeting it actually created. An all-day event is never pre-created (its
   start is a date anchor, not an instant), an existing meeting is never touched,
   and a cache row whose id fails `safe_meeting_id` is skipped as corruption.

The tick returns the next delay, read from `calendar.poll_interval_secs` each
time, so a cadence changed in Settings takes effect without a restart. A provider
failure is logged at INFO and the loop keeps its schedule; any other exception in
a tick is logged at WARNING and the loop continues after the default interval.
Polling rather than provider push, because the gateway is normally reachable only
on loopback and both Google's and Microsoft's push APIs need an internet-reachable
HTTPS endpoint.

Config keys (`calendar.*`, validated by `PUT /config`): `auto_sync` (bool,
default on), `poll_interval_secs` (`CALENDAR_POLL_MIN_SECS`..`CALENDAR_POLL_MAX_SECS`,
default `CALENDAR_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS`), `precreate_lead_minutes`
(`0`..`CALENDAR_PRECREATE_LEAD_MAX_MINUTES`, default
`CALENDAR_PRECREATE_LEAD_MINUTES`; `0` disables pre-creation while keeping the
sync). `read_config` fills the three into a `calendar` block written before they
existed. The dashboard list re-reads the calendar cache and the meetings on disk
every minute while it is open, so a pre-created meeting appears without a remount.

## Transcript UI and speech-to-text

Kiro Crew's own `/api/ws/stt` (`dashboard/stt_stream.py`).
`hooks/useMeetingTranscription.ts` conforms to that endpoint's existing wire
protocol — connect, wait for `{"type":"ready"}`, send 16 kHz Int16 PCM from
`/pcm-worklet.js`, receive `partial`/`final`/`error`, send `{"type":"stop"}` and
let the server close so trailing finals arrive. Every FINAL segment is POSTed to
`…/dispatch`, which stores it and feeds the agents. Partials remain browser-only:
they drive both the compact caption and one clearly marked live row, then disappear
when the recognizer finalizes or the stream closes. The browser keeps only a
bounded recent-final buffer for the caption because the JSONL file owns history.

`TranscriptPanel` is always present in a meeting and remains available during
action-item review. With at least one enabled note or diagram agent,
`MeetingWorkspace` gives the transcript a 360 px right-hand column beside the
scrolling agent grid (stacked on narrower screens). When the roster becomes empty,
the agent plane exits and the transcript expands to the primary content surface;
enabling an agent restores the split layout through a Framer Motion layout
transition that honors reduced-motion preferences. The panel follows new speech
until the reader scrolls up, then offers a localized “jump to latest” control
rather than pulling the reading position away. Lists above 200 durable segments
are virtualized so polling does not keep thousands of transcript rows mounted.
Only typed broadcasts carry a repeated source label; ordinary speech remains the
default visual rhythm. Empty copy distinguishes an active meeting from review or
ended states, and the durable list is not an ARIA live region because the compact
caption already announces recognizer updates.

Cloud transcription is optional (`pip install 'boto3>=1.34,<2' 'amazon-transcribe>=0.6,<1'`). When it
is absent the endpoint answers a friendly WS error, the hook surfaces it as a
toast, and the user can still type into the broadcast bar to feed the agents.

## Security posture

* **Path containment.** `store.safe_meeting_id` is the only way a client-supplied
  id becomes a path segment (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]` after the one documented `:` → `_`
  substitution, leading dots refused). `store.contain` is the barrier every
  derived path passes through: `resolve()` collapses `..` AND follows symlinks,
  then containment under the data root is asserted; callers must use the returned
  path. A violation is SEL-audited and raises. Tests cover traversal, a symlink
  planted inside the data dir, and non-string ids.
* **Deny-by-default authorization.** `_common.require_enabled` refuses every
  route while the app is disabled (routes are registered once at startup, so a
  default-disabled app would otherwise stay callable). `is_app_enabled` runs off
  the loop.
* **Owner-edit isolation.** User-edited minutes live under the fixed
  `<KIROCREW_HOME>/apps/meetings/data/edits/` sensitive root, outside the meeting
  directories given to agents. The shared hook gate denies both reads and writes
  from file tools (and shell equivalents), while the app's direct backend I/O
  remains available. This is the enforcement boundary; flat agent filenames alone
  are not treated as authorization.
* **Redaction.** Transcripts, agent outputs, extracted tasks, and calendar fields
  are LLM/user content on the way to disk, the dashboard, or a task provider, so
  `security.redact` (exfiltration URLs + credentials) is applied at each
  boundary: before the transcript append/fan-out, the outputs response, task
  normalization, `TaskDraft.sanitized`, and `parse_ics`.
  One deliberate asymmetry in `GET …/outputs`: the **generated** half is
  redacted on every read, while a user's **edit** of an agent's minutes is
  served as saved. The editor accepts arbitrary owner-authored text, including
  pasted text that merely resembles a credential, so re-scrubbing would silently
  modify the user's document. Redaction remains on the untrusted model-generated
  half of the boundary.
  Pinned both ways by `test_meetings_minutes.py::TestRedaction`.
* **Strict field readers.** `_common.field_bool` refuses a non-boolean rather
  than coercing (`bool("false")` is `True`, which would invert a mute decision);
  `field_str` treats a non-string as missing rather than stringifying it. The
  minutes PUT has its own 3 MiB body cap: it covers the 200,000-character limit
  even when a valid JSON client uses twelve-byte UTF-16 surrogate escapes, while
  every ordinary short-field route keeps the shared 256 KiB cap.
* **Narrow config writer.** `PUT /config` is an allow-list, not a merge: an
  unknown provider id collapses to the default, an agent id that is not a safe
  slug is dropped, and an agent-spec reference with `..` or a leading `/` becomes
  `""`.
* **Model-generated HTML.** The sketch artist writes HTML *from* the transcript,
  which anyone who speaks in the meeting can influence, so the frame takes three
  independent controls — each one added because the previous one turned out to be
  insufficient. All three are built by
  `website/src/apps/meetings/lib/sketchSrcdoc.ts`; the markup is never mounted
  into the dashboard's own DOM.

  1. **Null-origin sandbox.** `srcDoc` iframe with `sandbox="allow-scripts"` and
     **no** `allow-same-origin`, so nothing in the frame can read this page, its
     cookies, or the gateway. A test pins the absence of `allow-same-origin`.
  2. **Egress-denying CSP.** The sandbox says nothing about OUTBOUND requests, so
     a `<meta>` CSP is emitted as the first child of `<head>` (ahead of every
     model byte — a meta policy only binds from where it is parsed):
     `default-src 'none'`, `connect-src 'none'`, `img-src data:`, `font-src
     data:`, `form-action 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, and `script-src` pinned to
     the single vendored same-origin Mermaid FILE. The frame needs no network, so
     it is granted none.
  3. **Model script is stripped.** The CSP must grant `script-src
     'unsafe-inline'` for the Mermaid bootstrap, which also let the *model's*
     inline script run — and script can loop `document.createElement('link')`
     with `rel="dns-prefetch"` to stream the transcript out through DNS lookups
     that no CSP directive governs. An earlier revision recorded this as an
     accepted "hostname-only" residual; **that assessment was wrong** (it assumed
     the channel was limited to static markup, and treated ~200 bytes per
     unlimited repeatable lookup as a trickle). The document is therefore scrubbed
     before serialization: `script` (HTML and SVG), `iframe`/`frame`,
     `object`/`embed`/`applet`, `link` (every `rel`, not an allowlist),
     `meta`, `base`, `template` and `noscript` are removed as elements; `on*`
     handler attributes are removed; and `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/non-image
     `data:` URLs are removed from URL attributes (matched after stripping
     whitespace and control characters, which the HTML URL parser ignores).
     Remote-URL *fetches* are left to the CSP rather than pattern-matched.

  Mermaid still renders, and this is what makes control 3 affordable: it is driven
  by KiroCrew's own bootstrap from the declarative `div.mermaid` / fenced
  ```mermaid markup the agent is instructed to emit, so the agent has no
  documented need to ship JS. Both directions are tested in
  `website/src/test/sketchSrcdoc.test.ts` — nothing executable survives, **and** a
  Mermaid diagram plus an inline-styled HTML table still render (the guards
  against over-stripping the panel into a blank).
* **A client-supplied FILE path exists in exactly one place** — the audio import —
  and it goes through `hooks.validate_file_path` rather than a local check, so it
  gets the same canonicalization and `is_sensitive_path` verdict as every other
  file read in the product. The format check runs on the canonical path, so a
  symlink cannot use its own name to pass it.
* **No blocking call on the loop.** The calendar fetch is aiohttp; transcript
  reads/appends, DNS validation, the local `.ics` read, the data-dir seed, the
  enable check, the task-provider `create`, the import's path vetting and
  speech-to-text availability probe, and every store read and the init
  transaction inside a calendar-poller tick all run on an executor.

## What the port changed

See `ATTRIBUTION.md` for the table. In short: the internal task system became
the task-provider seam, the internal calendar MCP became the calendar-provider
seam, the second (separately built, internally sourced) speech-to-text daemon was
deleted in favour of KiroCrew's own, the standalone server became in-gateway
routes, the shell-blob self-heal cron became Python at startup, and the
internal-git update-check cron was deleted (a builtin versions with the package).

## Tests

`test/test_meetings_store.py` (containment, layout, config),
`test_meetings_dictionary.py` (matching + hostile input),
`test_meetings_session.py` (dispatcher, breaker, lifecycle, prompts),
`test_meetings_providers.py` (both registries, the `.ics` parser,
scheme/address refusals), `test_meetings_routes.py` (the HTTP contract,
validation, redaction, the enable gate), `test_meetings_calendar_poller.py` (the
due-event rule, a tick against a real `.ics`, pre-creation as init-not-start, the
loop surviving a bad tick, the settings round trip), `test_meetings_minutes.py` (the
editable minutes: sidecar ownership, the read overlay, staleness, the widget
gate, redaction asymmetry, body caps), `test_meetings_translation.py` (the
injection guard, the bounded queue, off-by-default), and
`test_meetings_audio_import.py` (the split's boundary rules, the refusals in
ORDER, and the shared dispatch transaction), with the shared fixtures and the
fake session manager in `test/meetings_helpers.py`. Every dispatch goes through
that fake session manager; no test spawns a process, opens a socket, calls a
model, or decodes audio.

These live in the repo-level `test/` tree, not an in-package `tests/`:
`setup.cfg` sets `testpaths = test transfer`, so a test under
`src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/...` is never collected by CI.

Frontend: `website/src/test/MeetingsApiClient.test.ts` (fetch-boundary
translation), `MeetingsSessionLogic.test.ts` (dedup, preset resolution, the
transition table), `MeetingsAgentPillBar.test.tsx`, `MeetingsBroadcastBar.test.tsx`,
`MeetingsAgentPanel.test.tsx` (including the iframe sandbox),
`MeetingsTranslation.test.tsx`, and
`MeetingsTranscriptPanel.test.tsx` (durable/live rows, follow mode, and the
split-to-primary layout transition).
