# Crew Mode

Two related things are spelled *crew*, and this spec owns both:

1. **A crew** is a named entry in the config's `agents` map. It binds a kiro-cli
   agent template plus a workspace, a memory store, a model and a reasoning
   effort, and it carries free-text `triggers` that decide whether the
   orchestrator may route work to it. The selection path is the `select_crew`
   MCP tool.
2. **Crew Mode** is the `"crew"` chat-slot mode. Its control plane is
   `crew_chat.py`: a durable per-slot ingress queue, a single-flight decision
   agent, and one continuable sub-session per topic, all running on the slot's
   crew.

Neither is *Remote Instances* (see [instances.md](instances.md)), and neither is
an Issue Radar *crew*, which is that app's own repository work crew
(see [issue-radar.md](issue-radar.md)).

## Crew records and binding

A crew lives only in `config.json` under `agents.<name>`. It is not a kiro-cli
agent file: `kiro_agent` points at one. `resolve_agent_bindings` turns a crew
name into `ResolvedBindings`, in this order:

1. the named crew, when it is a key of `config.agents`;
2. otherwise a **materialized** kiro agent of that name (an app-registered agent
   under the user's `~/.kiro/agents/`, or a project agent), which keeps
   dispatching itself while taking the default crew's workspace and memory
   bindings;
3. otherwise `default_agent`, with `requested_resolved` set to `False` so a
   caller never advertises a binding that is not running.

An unresolvable workspace or memory store falls back to `default_workspace` /
`default_memory_store` with a logged warning rather than failing the session.
With no agents configured at all the resolver returns bare defaults.

`resolve_effective_model` is the single source of truth for what model a new
session on a crew starts with, highest tier first: the crew's own `model`, the
bound kiro agent's pinned model (skipped for the built-in `kirocrew` agent), the
global `agent.model`, then the installed agent file's model. A per-session pick
outranks all four and is not considered there.

The loader is defensive about hand-edited config: a non-string `model` or
`triggers` collapses to `""`, an unknown `reasoning_effort` collapses to inherit,
and a junk watchdog override collapses to `0`.

## Selection: the `select_crew` contract

`select_crew` has two modes, both answered as JSON by `_do_select_crew`.

**Roster** (`crew` omitted or empty):

```json
{"default_agent": "default",
 "crews": [{"name": "oncall", "triggers": "incident, prod outage"}],
 "guidance": "Select a crew ONLY when its triggers clearly and specifically match…"}
```

Three rules define that list, and each is load-bearing:

- A crew whose `triggers` is empty or whitespace is **omitted entirely**. There
  is no fallback to `description`: no triggers means not a routing candidate.
- `default_agent` is omitted, because it is the caller.
- The response carries `default_agent` and `guidance` so the model has an
  explicit fallback and a high-confidence bar rather than inferring one.

**Bind** (`crew` names a roster entry):

```json
{"crew": "oncall",
 "bound": {"kiro_agent": "oncall-agent", "workspace": "/…/oncall",
           "memory_store": "oncall-mem", "model": ""}}
```

An unknown name answers `{"error": "unknown crew '…'", "available": "…"}`. The
membership test against `cfg.agents` is the deny-by-default gate;
`SELECT_CREW_SCHEMA` deliberately does not impose a name grammar, because crew
creation only strips the name, so a stricter schema would list a crew in the
roster and then refuse to bind it.

A bind also records a routing-decision pointer through
`members.record_activity` with `via="select_crew"`. Two properties of that write
matter:

- The entry keys the session under `decided_in`, not `session`, because the
  decision is made in the parent session while the crew runs somewhere else. A
  consumer counting sessions a crew took part in therefore cannot miscount a
  session the crew never ran in.
- The caller's memory mode is resolved at the call, and only `persistent`
  sessions are recorded. An unreadable session degrades to the private spelling,
  so the failure mode is a missing entry, never a durably logged private session
  key.

These entries are **intent, not execution**: binding a crew does not oblige the
model to delegate to it, and no `via="spawn"` execution entry exists today.

## Delegating to a bound crew

`select_crew`'s guidance is to delegate with `spawn_run(agent=<crew>)`, and the
sharp edge there is named rather than smoothed over: `subagent._validate_agent`
checks `agent=` against the installed kiro-cli **template** names
(`agent_discovery.list_agents`, plus the requesting project's cached agent
names), not against `config.agents`. A crew name is therefore dispatchable only
when an installed agent of the same name exists. That holds for every crew whose
`kiro_agent` repeats its own name, and not for the default crew, which binds the
template `kirocrew`.

A named-but-unknown agent is **refused**, never silently answered by the default
agent, with the machine-readable code `agent_not_found`. That refusal is a
privilege boundary: the default agent frequently runs at broader approval, so a
typo'd or injected name falling back to it would be an escalation at the manager
primitive. An empty `agent` still means "use the default".

Crew Mode resolves the alias itself instead of relying on the coincidence:
`CrewOrchestrator._dispatch_agent` calls `resolve_agent_bindings` per dispatch
and passes `bindings.kiro_agent`. It returns the raw crew name when
`requested_resolved` is `False`, so an unknown crew is refused by
`_validate_agent` rather than quietly running the default agent under a stale
name, and it resolves an empty crew too so the concrete template stays inside
`capabilities.spawn.scopes.agents`.

## Crew Mode: the slot mode

`api_chat_slot_mode` admits `""`, `"orchestrator"` and `"crew"`
(`chat_folders._VALID_MODES`). `"crew"` is the only one with a capability gate,
and four refusals guard the switch:

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `crew_unsupported_slot` | `crew_chat.is_crew_capable_slot_key(slot.key)` is false: the folded key is nothing but dots, ends in a dot (Win32 strips it, merging two slots onto one store), or is a Win32 reserved device basename |
| `member_mode_locked` | The slot is a member DM thread; member slots are born and retired only through the members thread endpoint |
| `remote_mode_unsupported` | `slot.executor == "remote"`: a mode-specific dispatch runs its tools on this machine, not on the bound peer |
| `crew_app_session_unsupported` | Refused at ingest for an app-owned slot, because dispatch does not preserve the app identity and the subagents would run outside the app's profile |

The switch is additionally refused while the slot has pending subagent work, in
either direction, keyed on `effective_session_key(slot)` so a channel-linked
slot is checked under the key its spawns actually ran on. The busy check runs
inside the state-wide slot-metadata transaction lock and fails closed.

The mode is preview-gated in the UI: `PREVIEW_CREW` (Settings → Developer →
Feature Previews) gates both doors, the Crew Members rail item and the sidebar's
"New Crew Mode chat" entry. The gate is on ingress only, so a session already in
crew mode keeps running when the flag goes off.

## Crew Mode data flow

Store layout is `<data home>/crew/<folded slot key>-<8 hex digest>/` holding
`queue.json`, `topics.json`, `forwards.json` and `slot_key`. The digest is taken
over the exact key, so two keys differing only in case get distinct directories
on a case-insensitive filesystem; the readable half is capped, so an overlong
slot name cannot produce a path the filesystem refuses. Because the directory
name is a fold plus a digest it cannot be decoded back, which is why the exact
key is written into `slot_key` and read from there on resume.

One request walks this path:

1. `CrewOrchestrator.ingest` takes a per-slot `asyncio.Lock` before any await,
   so the order requests reach the lock is the order they surface.
2. The entry is appended and `queue.json` is awaited **by name** before anything
   the user can see. A failed write rolls the in-memory entry back, so a 500
   leaves nothing queued.
3. The echoed user message and a templated ack are posted durably. A
   non-durable transcript row is logged loudly and the request still runs: the
   queue is the record, and the transcript is its mirror.
4. A decision pass is scheduled. It is single-flight per slot, prompts a
   tool-free background call with a rendered state snapshot, and accepts only a
   dict carrying an `actions` list, so braced JSON in surrounding prose is not
   mistaken for the payload.
5. Each action is applied: `route` an existing topic, `spawn` a new one, `hold`
   until a running topic finishes, `steer` a droppable advisory correction into
   in-flight work, `ask` one short disambiguating question, or `meta` answer a
   question about the topics themselves.
6. A `spawn` persists a stable `dispatch_id` and awaits a queue-only barrier
   before starting the run, so a crash between the spawn and the accepted-state
   write is adopted on restart instead of re-executing the task.
7. Sub-tasks carry `_SUB_TASK_SUFFIX`, which forbids nested subagents and
   requires a `<<<SUMMARY … >>>` block; `on_subagent_done` extracts it with
   `_SUMMARY_RE` and forwards it verbatim with mechanical attribution. A result
   arriving while the tab is closed is persisted to `forwards.json` and
   re-delivered on reopen.

Caps and timeouts, all named constants in `crew_chat.py`: `_DECISION_TIMEOUT`
45s, `_DECIDE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` 3 (a pass that settles nothing eventually fails the
entry visibly, because silence is the one outcome the user cannot act on),
`_QUEUE_TERMINAL_CAP` 200 and `_TOPIC_IDLE_CAP` 200 (a running or held topic is
never pruned).

## Failure modes

- **A broken store file is fatal, not empty.** `CrewStore._load` treats only
  `FileNotFoundError` as "nothing enqueued yet". Collapsing every read error to
  `[]` made the next `save()` write that emptiness back, erasing pending
  requests and undelivered forwards. A wedged slot is recoverable; an erased
  queue is not.
- **Writes never block the loop.** A two-lock split keeps the sequence
  bookkeeping off the disk path, so a slow filesystem cannot stall unrelated
  chats; `wait_writes` and `wait_for` are how a caller awaits a specific write.
- **A permanent delete is remembered.** `purge_slot` marks the key so an
  in-flight decision pass cannot dispatch into a deleted conversation, and only
  a fresh request clears the mark.
- **Restart reconciliation adopts, it does not re-run.** `resume_persisted_slots`
  reads store directories, recovers each exact key, and reconciles claimed
  entries against live runs and durable evidence.
- **A temporary slot does not leak memory.** Crew dispatch forwards the slot's
  `blocks_reads` flag, so a temporary crew slot injects no stored memory or
  lessons into the subagents it spawns.
- **An unreadable member rules file stops the member.** `read_member_rules`
  raises `MemberRulesUnreadable` for a file that exists but cannot be parsed, and
  `member_turn_context` guarantees every member turn either delivers the current
  section or runs the standalone fail-closed rules read.

## Boundaries

- A crew's `triggers` is free text read by a model. It is not a matcher, and no
  regex interprets it.
- `POST /api/agents` requires an explicit `kiro_agent`; the silent `"kirocrew"`
  default is refused, because it made every template-less crew an alias for the
  default agent. A template absent from the installed listing is accepted with a
  warning rather than refused, since an edition may resolve a row the listing
  cannot see.
- A credential-shaped crew name is refused at creation, and roster values are
  masked for every caller but the owner. An already-stored name is not renamed
  retroactively, which is why the owner keeps reading it verbatim: a name must
  be legible to be renamed.
- `kirocrew`, `kirocrew-conductor`, `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` and
  `kirocrew-security-conductor` are in `UNADVERTISED_AGENTS`, so they never
  appear in a rendered roster.

## Tests that pin this

| Test | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `test/test_select_crew.py` | Roster excludes the default crew and every triggerless crew, carries `default_agent` plus guidance; a named crew returns its bindings; an unknown name returns `error` plus `available`; the schema accepts spaces and dots in a crew name |
| `test/test_crew_chat.py` | Store round-trip and persistence, dots-only and dot-bearing key handling, the durable-read boundary, ingest enqueue/ack/schedule ordering, write-failure rollback, and that an unreadable store file is not read as empty |
| `test/test_crew_http.py` | Interleaved messages end to end, completion forwarding and held dispatch, mode-switch refusals (bad mode, app-owned slot, unstorable name), the busy/idle switch guard, and that a refused ingest is not a 200 |
| `test/test_crew_store_read_retry.py`, `test/test_crew_store_write_retry.py` | Retrying reader and writer behaviour around the atomic store files |
| `test/test_crew_reasoning_effort.py` | Per-crew effort reaches a crew dispatch |
| `test/test_members.py`, `test/test_members_dm_thread.py` | Slug validation and containment, activity recording and dedupe, DM-binding canonicality, rules and briefing reads |
| `test/test_chat_send_agent_model_default.py` | The crew model default a new session starts on |

## Design of record

[`../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md`](../../request-for-change/rfc-orchestrator-chat-sessions.md)
carries the intent behind the Crew Mode control plane. This spec is the contract
for what ships.
