"""Example dynamic workflow: Kiro Crew's own scheduled morning triage.

Shows the primitives that make Kiro Crew workflows MORE than an external agent
CLI's workflows — persistence, cron self-scheduling, memory-aware behavior,
nudges, and Slack delivery. Illustrative only — DSL not implemented yet.

Author once; it re-arms itself daily and learns which finders are noisy.
