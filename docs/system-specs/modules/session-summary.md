# Session Summary

## Overview

The session summary is an intent-level description of a chat session, generated
after a turn completes and rendered in the chat right panel. Its purpose is
narrow: make **re-entering** a session cheap. A person who kicked off work, got
pulled away, and came back needs three things — why they asked for this, what
happened, and what to do next — without re-reading the transcript.

The organizing unit is an **intent**: a goal the person pursued, which can span
many turns. It is not a per-turn log and not a diff. A session where the person
pivoted produces several intents.

Off by default. Generating a summary spends tokens on a turn the user did not ask
to pay for, so the whole subsystem is inert until `session_summary.enabled`.

| Concern | Module |
|---|---|
| Config section and its clamps | `config/loader.py` (`SessionSummaryConfig`) |
| Transcript extraction, payload shaping | `session_summary.py` |
| Turn-end generation, the prompt | `dashboard/chat_summary.py` |
| Sidecar cache | `history.py` (`ConversationLog`) |
| Read endpoint | `dashboard/chat_handlers.py` (`api_chat_slot_summary`) |

## Storage: a sidecar, never the transcript

Summaries live in `~/.kiro/crew/sessions/.intents/<safe_key>.json`, keyed by the
session's **transcript** key, with the payload shape below plus the `sig` and
`gen` fields that together identify the transcript it describes.

```json
{"sig": 1760000000.5, "gen": 3, "generated_at": 1760000123.1, "user_turns": 7,
 "last_activity": "2026-08-10T10:00:00+00:00",
 "intents": [ … ], "constraints": [ … ]}
```

Three properties of this arrangement are load-bearing:

**The transcript is never rewritten.** A summary write touches only the sidecar.
The session JSONL's mtime is the cache-validity signature for *every* derived
artifact and the sort key for `list_sessions`, so a write that advanced it would
invalidate unrelated caches and reorder the user's session list. Housekeeping
rewrites (title edits, consolidation, rotation) deliberately restore the previous
mtime for the same reason — see `history.md`. `test_session_summary_storage.py`
pins that writing and reading a summary leaves the transcript's bytes and mtime
untouched.

**Identity is `sig` + `gen`, and freshness requires BOTH to match.** `sig` is the
session file's mtime: any real append advances it, so it catches the ordinary
case for one `stat`, with no content comparison. `gen` is
`rotation_generation` — the transcript's content-identity counter.

The second half is not redundant, because the first half has a blind spot the
paragraph above creates. Housekeeping that CHANGES the messages — a rotation,
the dashboard rewrite save (regenerate / rewind / fork), a channel transcript
merge — deliberately restores the previous mtime so it does not reorder
`list_sessions`. Against mtime alone those rewrites are invisible, and a summary
describing the pre-rewrite conversation stayed valid indefinitely: unlike the
in-process caches, a sidecar is a FILE, so the staleness survived a restart. All
of them advance the content generation, which is what `gen` reads.

Metadata-only rewrites do NOT invalidate. `mark_consolidated` rewrites the
metadata line and never touches a message, so it moves neither signal — an
LLM-generated summary is not discarded for bookkeeping that did not change what
it describes.

**The pass flushes the slot before it captures `sig`.** `_ChatSlot.append` marks a
slot dirty and leaves the disk write to the 5s `_flush_loop`, and this pass is
dispatched from `_finish_queue_cycle` in the same synchronous block that appended
the turn's final assistant message. So at dispatch the transcript is always
missing the very turn being summarised, and a signature taken then is invalidated
the moment the loop fires — mid-model-call, since that call takes seconds. Every
write was refused, on every turn, and the "don't advance the turn mark, the next
turn retries" recovery could not converge because each turn reproduces it.
`state.flush_slot_now(slot)` lands the pending write first, so the signature
stamps the transcript the summary actually describes.

Clearing the dirty bit is part of that, not incidental: a flush that wrote the
bytes but left the slot dirty would be re-saved by the loop moments later, moving
the mtime again. `flush_slot_now` is shared with `_flush_dirty_slots` so the
generation-compare bookkeeping that makes the clear safe lives in one place.

**It is a different file from the one-line summary.** `.summaries/<key>.json`
holds the on-demand one-line description shown in the sessions list, written by
`set_cached_summary`, which overwrites the whole file. It carries the same
`sig` + `gen` identity and is validated the same way — the blind spot above is
a property of the transcript, not of either consumer. The two artifacts have
independent writers and independent triggers, so sharing a file would have them
clobbering each other — exactly the read-modify-write race the sidecar design
exists to avoid.

Both sidecars are reaped by `delete_session`, which is contractually a permanent
removal: a deleted session must leave no orphaned model-generated text on disk.

**The write is guarded against resurrecting a delete.** Generation holds no lock
while the model call is in flight (it can take tens of seconds), so a permanent
`delete_session` can complete in that window — removing the transcript and both
sidecars. `set_cached_intent_summary` therefore takes `_locked(key)` and writes
only if the transcript still exists with the exact signature the generation
started from; otherwise it refuses (returns `False`) and the generator discards
the payload without pushing a WS update or advancing its turn mark. The same
check drops a summary a mid-generation append has already made stale, rather
than storing it as the latest word.

**Both halves of the identity are snapshotted by the CALLER, before the model
call.** The generation is captured next to `sig`, never read at write time, for
the same reason the guard above exists: a content rewrite landing mid-generation
preserves the mtime while advancing the generation, so reading it at write time
would stamp the NEW content's identity onto the OLD summary and bless it as
fresh — and with the mtime preserved, nothing downstream could ever catch it.
`set_cached_intent_summary` refuses a payload whose generation moved, exactly as
it refuses one whose mtime moved; `set_cached_summary` records the snapshot, so
the entry it writes is already invalid on the next read. This mirrors
`mark_consolidated`, which likewise takes the generation its caller snapshotted
rather than sampling it after the slow call.

### Keyed on the transcript key, not the slot key

The cache is keyed by `slot_history_key(slot)`. That differs from `slot.key` for a
channel-born slot the dashboard could not bind, and keying on the slot key would
stat a file no read path addresses — the summary would be written to a phantom
transcript and the panel would never find it. Generator and endpoint resolve the
same key for this reason.

## Payload shape

Each intent carries:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `title` | The goal, short, in the person's terms |
| `ranges` | **List** of `[first_user_turn, last_user_turn]` pairs |
| `status` | `active` \| `completed` \| `abandoned` — about the work |
| `verified` | `true` \| `false` \| `null` — about the result, independent of status |
| `state` | Derived single word the panel renders |
| `last_touched_turn` | Highest turn in `ranges`; the panel's sort key |
| `origin_turn` | The turn that triggered this intent, or `null` |
| `initial_intent` | Why the work started |
| `progress` | A runbook of what is true now, not a history |
| `next_steps` | `{what, why, expect}` — the summarizer's inferences |

**`ranges` is a list, and ranges may overlap.** An intent can go dormant and
resume days later, and one intent can sit inside another's span (a question asked
mid-intent whose answer becomes part of the work). A single interval cannot
express either, and forcing them apart would misdescribe the session.

**Status has two axes because they disagree in the cases that matter.** Work whose
discussion ended while the goal was never reached — diagnosed but never fixed,
merged but never run — is exactly what a person forgets. `status: completed` with
`verified: false` says that; one field cannot. `derive_state()` collapses the two
into the single word the panel shows, so both surfaces agree by construction:

| status | verified | state |
|---|---|---|
| `abandoned` | any | `dropped` |
| `completed` | `false` | `needs-you` |
| `completed` | `true` / `null` | `done` |
| `active` | any | `in-progress` |

`constraints` is session-level, not per-intent: recurring operational facts about
how this project has to be run (a required build flag, a step that must follow a
change, a name the user corrected). Capped by `max_constraints`, default 5 — a
long list stops being read. Durable cross-session preferences belong in
**lessons**, not here; this field is scoped to the session's project.

## Extraction: what the model actually reads

`extract_turns()` reduces raw transcript records to a bounded input:

- **`role` and `content` only.** Every other field is ignored, notably the `meta`
  blob on assistant rows — in one real 15.6 MB session, message content totalled
  602 KB and `meta` was the other 14.65 MB. Ignoring it rather than excerpting it
  is the single largest saving available.
- **Tool and error rows are dropped.** The assistant has already distilled them.
- **User messages whole, assistant messages excerpted** head-and-tail at
  `assistant_excerpt_chars` (default 400). Intent lives in the user's messages,
  which are small; progress lives in the assistant's, which are not.

Measured against three real sessions, this reads roughly 1% of a transcript's
bytes.

### Mechanically detectable traps live here

Two transcript shapes reliably produce a wrong summary and are both detectable
without judgement, so they are labelled in extraction rather than left to the
prompt:

- **Automation posting under `role: "user"`** — cron notifications, subagent
  completion events, auto-nudge cycles, structured monitor wakes, tool refusals,
  restored webhook context.
  These are flagged `injected`, excluded from the user-turn count, and rendered
  as `[automation, not the user]`. Counting one invents a goal the person never
  had.
- **A verbatim resend** of the previous user message is marked `repeat_of`. A
  resend looks identical to insistence, and reading it as insistence produces
  "the user asked repeatedly, so it was ignored" for a request that already
  succeeded.

An oversized user paste (a stack trace, a log dump) is capped so one paste cannot
crowd out the session; intent survives truncation.

## Generation

Dispatched from `_finish_queue_cycle` in `dashboard/chat_runner.py` — the post-turn
hub, alongside auto-titling — as a background task. Not from `hooks.py`: the
`Stop` hook event is script/config-driven and fires only for dashboard turns, and
shipped behavior does not belong on a user-extension seam.

`_should_summarize()` returns a **skip reason string** rather than a boolean, so a
declined pass is auditable in logs; a feature that silently declines to run is
indistinguishable from one that is broken.

| Reason | Cause |
|---|---|
| `disabled` | The flag is off — the common case, and it costs nothing |
| `in_flight` | A pass for this slot is already running. The marker is taken **before the first await**, so two concurrent callers cannot both reach the model call — on-demand generation made that reachable from two clients at once |
| `running` | A turn is in flight (`slot.running`). Consulted directly rather than inferred from the stop reason, because the marker is cleared at turn start: an empty `_last_stop_reason` means BOTH "idle session restored in a later process" and "streaming right now". **Holds under `force`** |
| `memory_mode` | Incognito or temporary: no derived artifact from this conversation (mirrors `history.INCOGNITO_MEMORY_MODES` — a temporary transcript is discarded, so a persisted summary would outlive it) |
| `stop_reason:<r>` | The turn did not cleanly end |
| `too_few_turns` | Below `min_user_turns` |
| `cadence` | Fewer than `regenerate_after_turns` since the last pass |

**Only a clean `end_turn` qualifies — and the marker is fail-closed.** Timeout,
cancel-unacked, tool-stall and stale-recover all describe a turn that was cut
short; summarizing one would present interrupted work as concluded. Because
`_finish_queue_cycle` does not receive the stop reason, it is recorded on the slot
at `EVENT_COMPLETE` (`slot._last_stop_reason`) — and **cleared at turn start**, so
a turn that dies before `EVENT_COMPLETE` (ACP crash, auth expiry, transport drop)
leaves an empty marker rather than the previous turn's stale `end_turn`. The gate
requires the marker to equal `end_turn` exactly; empty means "this turn never
finished" and skips as `stop_reason:missing`.

**Input is the full on-disk transcript, not `slot.messages`.** A restored slot
keeps only the most recent 500 messages in memory (`chat_persistence` caps the
restore), so summarizing the in-memory tail of a long session would regenerate
from a truncated view and overwrite the sidecar — earlier intents would silently
vanish from the panel. The generator reads `read_messages_chained()` off the event
loop; the cheap slot-level gates (disabled, unclean stop) run first so the common
skip cases cost no disk IO, and `extract_turns` still bounds what the model reads.

**An unchanged transcript costs nothing.** Before any model call the pass checks
the sidecar; a valid signature means the stored summary is already exactly right.
This is what makes the summary stable rather than a live feed — a property of the
cache, not something the UI has to enforce.

The model comes from `AgentConfig.resolve_model("background")`; the role never
inherits `agent.model`, so unattended summarization cannot ride the interactive
flagship. Every failure path is swallowed and logged: a lost summary must never
surface as a failed turn, and the previous cached summary stays valid.

On success, `push_session_summary()` broadcasts `{"_type": "session_summary"}` so
the panel invalidates immediately rather than polling.

`_broadcast` must carry a **typed** WS branch for it — `{"type":
"session_summary", "data": {"key": ...}}`. This is not cosmetic: the generic
`notification` fallback rewrites the envelope as `{"type": "notification"}`, and
because the client dispatches on the outer `type`, its `case 'session_summary'`
would never match. The panel would then never invalidate — and since it
deliberately does not poll, a missed broadcast is not a late update but no update
at all until the user reloads. The fallback also dispatches the payload as a
Notification, adding a `ts`-less entry to the bell feed.
`test_session_summary_api.py::TestSessionSummaryBroadcast` pins the envelope.

The client closes the same gap on its other edge: `useWebSocket`'s reconnect
catch-up invalidates `['session-summary']` wholesale, because a summary
regenerated while the socket was down pushed a frame nobody received, and a
non-polling panel would otherwise keep showing the stale one until the tab
remounted. `useWebSocket.sessionSummary.test.ts` covers both the live frame and
the reconnect.

### The prompt's trap list is tested

The judgement traps cannot be detected in code, so the prompt names each one, and
`test_session_summary_generate.py` asserts the prompt still mentions them. A later
trim of the prompt fails a test instead of quietly degrading every summary:
retractions supersede the claim they retract; option lines are offers that were
mostly declined, not requests; merged is not verified; a feasibility question is
not a work order; facts go stale inside one session; a compaction is not a topic
boundary; the session title describes only its beginning.

The prompt also ranks the boundary signals: commits and merges punctuate a session
more reliably than any phrasing, timestamps separate a daily routine from a failed
retry, and a user correction is the highest-value signal per character in the file.

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/chat/slots/{slot}/summary
```

Read-only, and deliberately so: it never triggers generation. A panel that
generated on open would spend tokens on every look and reward refreshing — the
behavior the feature exists to remove.

| Response | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | `{enabled, stale, intents, constraints, generated_at, user_turns, last_activity, generate_state}` |
| `200` with `enabled: false` | Feature off; the panel explains itself rather than erroring |
| `404` `{"code": "slot_not_found"}` | Unknown slot, or a slot the calling app does not own |

While `enabled` is false the panel's `+`-menu row is **hidden** as well
(`newMenuSections` in `SidePanel.tsx`). The settings toggle ships separately, so
offering the row would send every reader to a panel that says the feature is off
and gives them no way to change it. `SidePanel` reads the flag from this same
endpoint under the same react-query key the tab uses, so it is one cheap
read-only request per slot that doubles as the tab's prefetch, and it fails OPEN
so a slow response can never hide a feature that is enabled.

### `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/summary` — generate on request

Same path, different verb, because **reading must stay free of side effects**: the
GET runs on every panel mount, and a query flag that could spend tokens on a read
would make opening the panel a purchase. This route exists because the turn-end
trigger alone leaves every session that predates the feature — or that has not been
touched since it was switched on — permanently empty, with nothing a person can do
about it from the panel.

Explicit consent is the whole justification for the spend, so there is **no batch
form**: one request summarizes one session.

| Response | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | The GET's body, once a summary exists |
| `409` `summary_disabled` / `summary_in_flight` / `summary_turn_running` / `summary_unavailable` | No summary could be produced; the code says which, so the panel can distinguish "wait" from "refused" |
| `404` `{"code": "slot_not_found"}` | Unknown slot, or a slot the calling app does not own |

A forced pass lifts **exactly two** gates — `stop_reason` and `cadence` — because
those bound spending nobody asked for, and an explicit click already carries the
consent they stand in for. `disabled`, `in_flight`, `memory_mode`, `running` and
`too_few_turns` all still hold, and the cache check is not skipped, so a second
click cannot buy an identical answer.

`generate_state` on the GET tells the panel which affordance to offer:
`ready` / `too_few_turns` / `unavailable`. It is decided server-side so the frontend
never re-implements the turn threshold, and it is **optional** in the payload so a
dashboard talking to an older gateway degrades to the read-only behaviour instead of
rendering a button the backend cannot serve. A turn in flight is deliberately NOT one
of its values: the field is only refreshed when a summary is *written*, so a mid-turn
verdict would arrive stale and stick when a turn ends without producing one. The
panel derives that state from its own live per-slot turn signal and disables the
button; the server stays authoritative via the `summary_turn_running` 409.

**Publishing requires the session to be quiescent, checked on both sides.** The
signature comparison in `set_cached_intent_summary` covers DISK (any append moves the
mtime and the write is refused). It cannot see MEMORY: a turn that starts during the
model call and has not reached the 5s flush leaves the mtime untouched, so the write
would be accepted and broadcast a summary omitting that turn as *current*. So
`running` and `_dirty` are re-read immediately before the write. Together the three
answer one question — is the transcript I summarized still the whole session?

`stale: true` means a summary exists but the transcript has moved on. The storedpayload is still returned: an empty panel reads as "this is broken" while a stale
one reads as "not regenerated yet", which is the truth. `read_intent_summary()` is
the non-strict accessor for this; `get_cached_intent_summary()` is the strict one
the generator uses.

The flag gates the READ as well as the write. Turning the feature off has to stop
serving summaries, not merely stop producing them — otherwise a sidecar written
during an earlier opt-in keeps being returned after opt-out, which is the opposite
of what the switch promises.

Reads are subject to App Kit §5.2 ownership isolation (mirroring
`api_chat_slot_delete`): a summary is derived conversation content, so a slot
merely existing must not make it readable. An app token may read only slots that
app created, never an unscoped slot; a dashboard user (explicit empty
`request["app"]`) is unaffected. A denied read answers `404`, not `403`, so a
foreign slot is indistinguishable from a missing one (anti-enumeration, CWE-204);
the true reason is recorded via SEL.

## Redaction

The payload is model output derived from transcript text, so anything the user
pasted into the conversation — a token, a key, a beacon URL — can be reproduced
inside it. `normalize_payload()` therefore runs the whole payload through the
standard `redact_credentials` + `redact_exfiltration_urls` chain before it is
returned, recursively: the payload nests (intents → next_steps → strings) and a
top-level-only pass would leave every field the panel actually renders unredacted.

Redaction sits in normalization rather than at the write site so that every path
into the sidecar is covered by construction, and at write time rather than render
time because the sidecar is durable — a secret written once would be served on
every subsequent open.

## Configuration

`session_summary` in `config.json`. All knobs exist so cost can be reduced without
losing the feature.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Top-level switch; the subsystem is inert while off |
| `min_user_turns` | `2` | A one-exchange session has no intent structure |
| `regenerate_after_turns` | `1` | Turns between rebuilds; raise to trade freshness for tokens |
| `max_intents` | `50` | Safety ceiling, not a display limit; the oldest-touched tail is dropped from the record before the write |
| `max_constraints` | `50` | Safety ceiling on project notes; `0` suppresses the section |
| `assistant_excerpt_chars` | `400` | Head/tail kept per assistant message |

Out-of-range values are clamped with a warning rather than raising, and a
malformed section degrades to defaults, so a hand-edited `config.json` cannot
prevent the gateway from starting.

## Scope in this release

**The boundary is the turn loop, not the surface.** `_should_summarize` contains
no check on where a message came from — it gates on `enabled`, an in-flight pass,
incognito mode, liveness, a clean `end_turn`, the turn count and the cadence, and
nothing else. Coverage is decided instead by *where the generator is called from*:
the automatic pass has exactly one dispatch site, `_finish_queue_cycle` at the
tail of a `_ChatSlot` turn in `dashboard/chat_runner.py`, plus the explicit
on-demand route in `dashboard/chat_handlers.py`. Only a turn that ran through
`_run_chat` on a slot reaches the automatic pass — and reaching it is not the same
as producing a summary, because the gates above still apply. The on-demand route
is the one path that produces a summary with no turn at all.

So the excluded set is every surface that owns its own turn loop, and it is wider
than "not the dashboard":

| Surface | Where its turn is driven instead |
|---|---|
| Slack | `slack/handler.py` (native ACP loop) or `messaging/driver.py` (`TurnDriver`) |
| Discord, Telegram, Teams, Webex, WeCom, WeChat | `messaging/driver.py` (`TurnDriver`), one shared loop |
| Task runner | `task_executor.py`, streaming an ACP client directly |
| Cron wake | `slack/gateway.py`; the result is *appended* into a `cron-<id>` slot by `dashboard/cron_inject.py` — a bare append with no turn lifecycle |
| Agent webhooks | `dashboard/handlers/hooks.py` |
| Workflow phase calls | `workflows/agent_exec.py` |
| Subagents | `subagent.py` — never a `_ChatSlot` at all, so a `.intents` sidecar is not reachable |
| `kirocrew chat` | `cli_chat.py`, straight onto the provider |

Two corollaries the "dashboard only" shorthand gets wrong in both directions.
The OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`dashboard/openai_compat.py`) calls `_run_chat` on
a real slot, so it **does** summarize — a single-shot ephemeral request still
stops at `min_user_turns`, but a caller reusing an `id` does not. And the
initiator is not the boundary: a Slack thread explicitly linked to a slot, an
auto-nudge cycle **on a dashboard slot** (a nudge on a channel key uses a separate
fire path and does not), a cron delivering with `session="origin"`, a workflow's
post-run auto-turn, and the task runner's review handoff to chat all cross into
`_run_chat`, and so reach the automatic pass on the dashboard session they drive —
never on themselves, and still subject to every gate above.

Excluding the channels is deliberate, and enforced rather than incidental:
`DashboardState` refuses to index a channel-born session's self-referential
`slack_thread_ts`, because binding it would make inbound Slack resolve to a
"linked" slot and silently change the execution engine and approval semantics of
all Slack traffic.

Widening coverage is therefore not a matter of threading the config flag to more
call sites — the flag is already global, and every excluded surface skips the
generator by never reaching its dispatch site. It needs either a turn-end dispatch
in each surface's own loop, or one shared post-turn boundary that all of them
cross. Note also that reaching the dispatch site is not sufficient: an auto-nudge
cycle does reach it, but a nudge row is persisted under role `nudge` and
`extract_turns` reads only `user` and `assistant`, so a nudge cycle never advances
`count_user_turns`. A nudge-only session therefore stays below `min_user_turns`
until a person types.

No governance capability scope. Nothing enforces one, and a scope is a data-only
addition later; if one is ever added it must be registered inline in
`SCOPE_CATALOG`, never lazily from a feature package, because
`load_security_policy()` runs at boot before feature imports.
