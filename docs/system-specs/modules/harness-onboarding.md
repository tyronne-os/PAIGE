# Onboarding a new ACP harness

[harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md) says what a new harness may **not** do to
the Kiro path. This file says what it **must** do to land at all, in the order
the work actually falls out.

The sequence below is derived from onboarding Codex (`ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`), not
reconstructed from KAS and Claude Code after the fact. That matters, because two
of the stages here did not exist as stages until a third harness needed them:
Stage 2 had five capability sets and no tuning channels at all, and Stage 6
was invisible while every known id happened to be selectable. A harness
that walks this list will find gaps the list does not predict; when it does, the
gap belongs here in the same change, as a stage — not in the harness's own
module as a special case.

## The two landing states

A harness lands in one of two states, and choosing between them is Stage 7, not
Stage 1:

- **Dormant.** The core can *spell* the id — it is in `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, it
  has a provider label, a policy name, and a decided membership in every
  capability set — but no operator can *choose* it. A dormant harness is not a
  stub: its spawn path can be complete. It is dormant because something a real
  session depends on cannot yet answer for it.
- **Selectable.** The id is in `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS`, or an edition
  called `register_selectable_backend`, so it renders in the dashboard switch
  and survives a config load.

Dormant is a legitimate destination, and shipping there deliberately is cheaper
than a long-lived branch. But it must be *named* as an exception (Stage 7), or
the narrowing check fails.

## Stage 1 — the vocabulary, in the leaf

Everything a consumer needs to *name* your harness goes in
`src/kiro_crew/acp_backends.py`, which imports no ACP and therefore may be
imported by anything:

| Add | Why there |
|---|---|
| `ACP_BACKEND_<NAME>` | The id. Never a bare literal at a call site (H5). |
| membership in `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` | `AcpProvider.__init__` rejects anything outside it (H8), and every capability set is asserted a subset of it. |
| `PROVIDER_LABEL_<NAME>` in `acp/types.py` | A closed mapping; an absent label means Kiro, so a harness without one persists as a Kiro session and has its transcript pruned for want of a Kiro session file (H11). |
| an entry in `POLICY_ID_BY_BACKEND` | A governance rule is written by a human as an identifier. The mapping is what makes the id nameable in a deny rule **before** anything registers it — so this is required even for a dormant harness. |

`acp/types.py` re-exports the vocabulary, so existing callers keep their import
site. Do not define the constants there: it is a forbidden root for the SDK
boundary gate, and a definition there is a definition consumers cannot reach
without crossing it.

## Stage 2 — an explicit decision for every capability set

There are fourteen sets. **"Inherited the default" is not a decision** — a
capability is granted by opt-in membership, never by negation (H6), so a set you
do not think about is a set you have silently opted out of. That is usually
right, and it must still be deliberate, because the review lane and the tests
both read the membership as a claim. `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` is not one of them: it
is the membership floor, not a capability. Neither is
`backends_retired_by_host_logout()`: whether a host logout may retire your running
child is a fact about how you sign in, so it is declared in Stage 5 and projected
from there rather than decided here. It is deliberately not an `ACP_BACKENDS_*` set
— that naming is vocabulary this module owns, and a derived answer is not
vocabulary.

| Set | Grants |
|---|---|
| `ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING` | One process may serve several sessions. Wrong membership hands a second session to a process that cannot hold it. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_STEER` | The `_session/steer` extension. A steer sent to a non-implementer answers `-32601`. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX` | The harness sandboxes itself, so Kiro Crew's own wrapper stands down. Security-relevant: wrong membership hands isolation to a layer that never starts (H7). |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME` | Driven through `AcpRuntime` rather than its own spawn branch. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_MODEL_VIA_CONFIG_OPTION` | Model switching lands as a config option rather than a protocol call. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_EFFORT_VIA_CONFIG_OPTION` | Reasoning-effort push, same channel shape. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_SLASH_COMMANDS` | Receives `_kiro.dev/commands/execute`, **and** gets the workspace `cli.json` overlay written for it. Membership decides both, so a non-member must not collect an overlay it never reads and the membership-gated clear can never remove. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY` | The harness reads its MCP surface from the `session/new` array rather than from Crew's agent spec. A non-member that is added here gets an empty array and works with every Crew tool silently absent. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_DISPATCH` | Crew's member-dispatch tools are mounted into a channel-member session, with the auto-approve grant that goes with them. A harness with no per-session mount to ride is excluded, which withholds only the extra grant. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` | The manual `/compact` entry points are offered. A non-member refuses the manual command up front rather than stranding the status waiter on a harness that emits no compaction status of its own. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_ADVERTISED_MODEL_SELECTION` | Membership buys two things, and a harness can need only one. First the CAPTURE: the list the harness advertises at `session/new` is written to the cross-session provider-model cache under the harness's own namespace, which is what `GET /api/models` reads back. Second the FOLD: a stored id is rewritten to the served spelling, at spawn and on a warm-pool `set_model`. A harness whose wire ids are already exact gets a no-op fold, so it joins for the capture alone — which is the whole point when its advertised select is the only source of ids it accepts back (codex). claude joins for both. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_SEED_LOCAL_SETTINGS` | A local settings file is seeded at spawn **and re-seeded on `set_model`**, so a warm-pool claim does not leave a stale model or allowlist behind. A harness with no such file is not a member. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_MCP_CONFIG_HOT_RELOAD` | The dashboard's MCP sync leaves running sessions alone after a config write, because the harness reconciles the agent file itself. Membership is version-gated per process by `mcp_hot_reload_supported`, not granted by the harness name alone. |
| `ACP_BACKENDS_STRUCTURED_REFUSAL` | The harness reports a model-side refusal with a **reason** — on the Kiro path a `_kiro.dev/metadata` frame with `stopReason: CONTENT_FILTERED` and a `refusal {category, explanation, recommendedModel}` object — and `acp/_dispatch.parse_refusal` is consulted on that frame. Every harness still lands on the same `RefusalInfo` and the same dashboard card; a non-member's card just has no category line. A harness whose refusal wire carries a reason in a different shape adds a parser and joins here — it must not widen the metadata reader to guess. |

The tuning channels are one set each rather than one "tuning" set, because a
harness can implement one and not another. If your harness needs a tuning
channel none of them describes, add a set — do not widen an existing one.

## Stage 3 — the spawn path

This is the irreducible new code, and on the harnesses measured so far it is the
largest single piece: `acp/client.py` grew between +194 and +806 lines per
harness. It is not reducible by refactoring, because it is the part that is
genuinely different.

What a harness needs, using the Codex adapter as the shape:

- **The adapter, and whether one is needed at all.** `codex-acp` exists because
  the `codex` CLI does not serve ACP — it reads `acp` as a prompt. The adapter is
  the transport, not an optimization. Establish this before anything else; a
  harness that speaks ACP natively skips most of this stage.
- **Binary and package constants** (`CODEX_ACP_BIN`, `CODEX_ACP_NPM_PKG`) and
  the package entry path.
- **A hoisted-dependency marker.** An adapter whose own dependencies are missing
  dies at ESM import time — *after* the child is spawned, which is the worst
  place to find out.
- **An explicit env override** (`CODEX_ACP_BIN`), spelled the way the adapter's
  own documentation spells it.
- **Resolution order**: project-local `node_modules` first, then global/PATH.
  Share the root discovery (`_vendored_acp_roots`) and join your own package
  path onto it. Generalizing that helper is allowed; it is harness-neutral and
  belongs to no harness. Adding a branch to the Kiro path is not (H13).

Constants an adapter reads *itself* from the ambient environment do not get a
constant here. Naming one implies a forwarding that does not exist — the Codex
seam documents exactly this asymmetry against its Claude counterpart, which *is*
explicitly forwarded.

## Stage 4 — the handshake, as your own literal

Protocol version and client capabilities stay per-harness literals (H10). Give
your harness its own `PROTOCOL_VERSION_<NAME>` **even when the number is
identical to an existing one.** That is not duplication: it makes a future
divergence a one-line edit here instead of a silent downgrade of whichever
harness happened to move first.

## Stage 5 — the auth declaration

How your harness signs in is one frozen `AgentAuthDeclaration` in
`src/kiro_crew/agent_sdk/host_auth.py`, plus your column in bucket 3 of
[agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md). **That is the whole auth cost.**
Everything else is a projection of that one literal: the read-gate floor that
fences your credential and re-anchors it under your own override variables
(`security/paths.py`), the sandbox credential mask and the single leaf it spares so
your own child can still authenticate (`agent_sdk/tool_gate.py`), the
the logout-recycle answer `backends_retired_by_host_logout()`, the `AcpAuthRequired` text
an operator reads when a session cannot start, the `auth` object on
`GET /api/acp-backends` (`dashboard/handlers/acp_backend_status.py`), and the
standing sign-in caveat the backend switch renders from it. You write the
declaration; you edit none of those.

It belongs after the handshake and before the install probe, because it is the
sign-in half of the question Stage 6 answers about files — a harness that is
installed and signed out still dies at `session/new` — and because the floor has
to be fencing your credential before Stage 7 lets an operator choose you.

| Field | What it commits the host to |
|---|---|
| `entitlement_source` | One of `host_identity_store` or `own_credential_file`. The doctor row and the logout policy branch on it, so a third spelling fails a test rather than reading as a harness nobody has an answer for; a harness entitled by the ambient cloud environment adds the third when it exists. |
| `credential_leaves` | The home-relative leaves you STORE, spliced onto the read-gate floor so an agent's file tools can read none of them. Empty when your entitlement is the host store: those locations are the host's, declared in `identity_stores.py`, and re-declaring them would hand a driver a say over the host's own store. |
| `home_override_env_vars` | The variables that relocate your credential `$HOME`. Every declared leaf is re-anchored under each of them, which is what keeps a relocated token fenced. |
| `adapter_own_leaves` | The leaf your own child must still read. A SUBSET of `credential_leaves`, and enforced as one: a driver may only ask the mask to spare a leaf its own declaration put on the floor, and `__post_init__` raises otherwise. |
| `sign_in_remedy` | A finished sentence, server-owned and rendered verbatim wherever it appears. Untranslated on purpose — a translated per-harness string is a per-harness edit to thirteen locale files by construction, and the harness nobody remembers to add is exactly the one that needs the sentence. |
| `host_logout_retires_children` | Whether a host logout may retire your already-running children. True only alongside `host_identity_store`; the other pairing is refused, because a logout says nothing about a store you never read. |

The declaration says what you **store**; the host still decides what is **fenced**.
That is why no field names a path to leave open in general, and why a malformed
declaration raises at import rather than reaching a floor that fences less than its
author believed.

`AgentInteractiveLogin` is the optional half, and the absence is the point. A
harness whose sign-in happens outside the product — in the operator's own terminal,
or in the harness's own CLI — simply does not implement it, and a consumer finds
that out with `isinstance` rather than by reading a boolean and then calling a
method that no-ops. No harness implements it today.

**Silence is not available at this stage.** `test_agent_sdk_host_auth.py` fails
when a member of `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` has no declaration, and
`missing_declarations` names the gap. The failure mode that gate closes is a
harness reaching `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS` without touching the credential
floor, and then serving sessions with a live agent-readable token that nothing
fences.

## Stage 6 — the install probe

`agent_sdk/backend_install.py` answers a question selectability does not: *is
this harness installed on this machine, and if not, what installs it?* It holds
one `_probe_<name>` per harness in `_PROBES`, each returning a
`BackendInstallState` naming the missing component and the command that fixes
it.

**This stage is the gate between dormant and selectable**, and it is the one
that is easy to skip because nothing fails without it. Nothing fails; the
operator does. A build that offers a switch with no probe behind it cannot tell
anyone what was missing when the session failed to start — the switch renders,
the session dies, and the dashboard has nothing to say.

## Stage 7 — selectability, or a named exception

With Stages 1–6 done, add the id to `BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS`.

If it is not done — most often Stage 6 — then the id is in
`ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN` but not in the baseline, which is a NARROWING. Name it in
`NOT_SHIPPED_SELECTABLE` in
`test_agent_backend_editable.py::test_baseline_ships_every_known_backend`, with
the reason. An explicit allowlist rather than a relaxed assertion is the point:
a plain `baseline != known` still fails, so an id may sit outside the baseline
only by being named.

Selectability has exactly one gate, `resolve_selected_backend`, and it logs
(H4). Do not add a static `enum` to `AgentConfig.acp_backend`: a literal frozen
at import cannot see a boot-time registration, and `validate_config_data`
*deletes* an out-of-enum value before the loader ever sees it — which strips a
registered harness from `config.json` with no degrade log at all.

## Stage 8 — what a live harness additionally touches

Stages 1–7 keep a harness inside `acp/`, `providers/`, and `acp_backends.py`. A
harness an operator can actually select spills further. Measured across the two
in-flight live-harness branches, roughly ten files outside those trees:

`dashboard/handlers/agents.py` (the largest, +213 on one branch),
`mcp_gateway/session_servers.py` (+112), `dashboard/kiro_readiness.py`,
`dashboard/handlers/kiro_prerequisite.py`, `dashboard/handlers/sessions.py`,
`agent.py`, `config/loader.py`, `providers/base.py`, `session.py`,
`subagent.py`, `cli_doctor.py`.

Two rules govern that spill. A capability the session layer reads off a provider
is declared on `LLMProvider` with a safe default, so an adapter never forces a
`hasattr` probe onto the Kiro path (H14) — the cost of obeying this is small,
around +11 lines in `providers/base.py` on the branch that needed it. And the
`ProviderRegistry` seam takes the addition without a `CONTRACT_VERSION` bump
(H13); if the Kiro construction path gains a conditional, a required argument,
or a new failure mode in service of your adapter, the design is wrong, not the
invariant.

## Gates and tests

Beyond the ordinary suite:

- **`scripts/check_harness_parity.py`** enforces Group B on the lines your diff
  *adds*, not the whole tree. Six rules, self-tested.
- **`scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`** is shrink-only. A new import of
  `kiro_crew.acp` or `kiro_crew.providers` from a consumer fails even though the
  existing baseline (`.github/agent-sdk-boundary-baseline.txt`) grandfathers a
  list of them. This is why Stage 1 puts the vocabulary in a
  leaf: a consumer naming your constant must not have to cross the boundary to
  do it.
- **`test_harness_parity.py`** pins the structural invariants (Groups A and C),
  so they fail in the ordinary test job rather than a separate gate.
- **Group D is review-only.** `AUTOSDE.yaml`'s `harness-parity` rule carries
  H13 and H14 to every AI review lane, because the absence of a mechanism is not
  something a source scan can see.
- **`./scripts/docs-lint.sh`** requires every doc to be reachable from its
  directory index, and checks that line citations still point at what they
  claim.

Never relax a check to make a red invariant green. If a harness genuinely cannot
be adapted within these invariants, the correct outcome is that it does not land
yet — say so in the PR instead of widening a seam.

## Worked example: the Codex seam

The Codex onboarding is a clean instance of stopping at Stage 7:

| Stage | State |
|---|---|
| 1 vocabulary | Done — `ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`, in `ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`, `PROVIDER_LABEL_CODEX`, policy name mapped. |
| 2 capability sets | Decided for every set: in the model and effort channels, out of the rest. All three channel sets were *created* by this work, which is why the tuning channels are three sets rather than one. |
| 3 spawn path | Done — adapter, npm package, dep marker, env override, project-local resolution. |
| 4 handshake | Done — `PROTOCOL_VERSION_CODEX`, its own literal at the same number as Claude's. |
| 5 auth declaration | Done — `own_credential_file`, `~/.codex/auth.json` on the floor with `CODEX_HOME` re-anchored, that same leaf spared for its own child, `.aws/config` re-exposed read-only, not retired by a host logout, and a two-branch remedy every consumer renders verbatim. |
| 6 install probe | Done — `_probe_codex` names `codex-acp` and the command that installs it. One component, not two: the adapter ships its own Codex binary. Credentials are deliberately NOT probed: a `missing` verdict disables the switch, and the checkable paths are not the only ones that authenticate a Codex. The sign-in answer is the Stage 5 declaration instead, and every consumer renders its remedy rather than carrying a string of its own. |
| 7 selectability | Selectable. `NOT_SHIPPED_SELECTABLE` is empty again, which is the healthy state. |
| routing | Done — `SESSION_CONFIG`, verified and applied as `mode=read-only` after session/new and before the first prompt, refusing otherwise. |
| residual | ACP v1 cannot require a prompt for a passive READ, so the sensitive-path block does not see this harness's reads. Mitigated at the OS boundary instead: its child cannot read the credential homes the standard tier leaves open. |
| 8 live spill | Not reached. |

The lesson worth carrying: the seam is dormant for exactly one reason, that
reason is written down where the narrowing check reads it, and closing it is a
single stage rather than a re-litigation. That is the shape to aim for — not
"complete or nothing", but "incomplete at a named stage".
