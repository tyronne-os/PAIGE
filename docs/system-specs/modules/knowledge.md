# Knowledge Module

## Overview

The Knowledge Library is Kiro Crew's personal knowledge graph: a local, SQLite-backed corpus that ingests documents (folders, uploads, artifacts, fetched URLs), chunks and entity-extracts them via a bounded LLM worker pool, and serves hybrid retrieval (FTS5 keyword + graph traversal + optional vector) to the LLM through the `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool. All ingestion and search stay on-host; the only external calls are the extraction/URL-fetch worker's ACP LLM turns. Embedding runs in-process against a vendored runtime, so there is no embedding endpoint at all.

```
files / uploads / artifacts / URLs
   → FileReader (read + extract text)
   → HeadingAwareChunker (chunk)
   → EntityExtractor / agent_fetch (LLMPool workers)
   → KnowledgeStore (SQLite: items + items_fts + graph)
   → HybridRetriever (FTS5 + graph + vector, RRF fusion)
   → local_knowledge_search (MCP) / dashboard Knowledge tab
```

### LLM worker-pool policy

Knowledge ingestion and URL-content acquisition use separate long-lived worker
pools. The extraction pool uses `knowledge.extraction_pool_size` and requests
Knowledge-specific reasoning effort `high`; the URL-fetch pool has one worker and
sends no explicit effort, so it retains the provider default. Both pools drive the
same `kirocrew-knowledge` agent and preserve the existing model resolution:
`knowledge.extraction_model` → `agent.model` → provider/`auto`.

The extraction effort is a Knowledge policy, independent of
`agent.role_efforts.background`, which controls other background workers. For the
Kiro ACP backend, the worker applies the requested level through the `/effort`
command; Claude ACP uses its advertised session config option. Capability
negotiation may select the highest supported level at or below `high`, while an
unsupported model or rejected command falls back to provider default.

Separate pools make the different workload policies structural for long-lived
sessions rather than relying on a worker being reused by only one workload by
convention.

## Role & boundary

The Knowledge Library is the agent's **precise-recall complement to memory** — it is defined as much by the two things it is *not*:

- **Not memory.** The memory subsystem (see `memory-skills-hooks.md`) carries the small, distilled, always-on picture and is **injected into every prompt** by `ContextBuilder`; it is lossy by design (it dedups, decays, and paraphrases). The Knowledge Library instead holds the durable, **verbatim, cited** detail that memory can only approximate, and it is **pulled on demand**: the LLM reaches it only through the `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool, never as per-turn context injection (§4). Its job is to surface the exact chunk — with a citation back to source (§4, "Citation enrichment") — precisely when memory's recall is imprecise or absent.
- **Not a workspace.** It is not scratch space for the current task's files or state; it is the durable, source-owned record that outlives any single task or session. A project directory enters the Library only as a `local_folder` source the user registers by hand, and is *ingested* read-only rather than adopted as a working set.

This is the boundary the agent's write path (§2b) captures against: verbatim, long-tail durable detail that memory would only paraphrase belongs here; small, always-shaping, distilled knowledge belongs in memory; transient current-task state belongs in neither. How well the KB fills that role is measured against the criteria in "Success criteria" below.

## Success criteria

The Knowledge Library's job — surface the exact, cited chunk when memory's recall falls short — is judged on **two tiers**. Tier 1 now has a deterministic in-tree harness (`kirocrew bench kb-retrieval`, see "What is measured today"); no Tier 2 harness exists in-tree yet. This section defines the target so a retrieval change (recency weighting, a reranker, content-typed TTL) can be judged against a fixed bar rather than by eye.

### Tier 1 — intrinsic retrieval quality

Against a **frozen golden set** of `(query → the chunk(s) that should answer it)`, does retrieval fetch the right chunk and rank it high? Definitions follow the IR / RAG canon:

| Metric | Definition | Reads |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **recall@k** | `|relevant ∩ retrieved@k| / |relevant|` — fraction of relevant chunks that land in the top-k | coverage / completeness |
| **precision@k** | `|relevant ∩ retrieved@k| / k` — fraction of the top-k that is relevant | signal-to-noise |
| **MRR** | mean of `1 / rank_of_first_relevant` over queries | how early the first hit lands |
| **nDCG@k** | graded relevance with a log-rank discount, normalized to the ideal ordering | rank quality when relevance is graded, not binary |
| **hit@k** | binary: did *any* relevant chunk make the top-k | cheap "did retrieval work at all" gate |

RAGAS names the rank-aware pair **context precision** / **context recall** (the latter needs a reference answer); they are the same two ideas applied to the retrieved context.

### Tier 2 — extrinsic task-lift

Does that recall change the outcome? Measured A/B — the same task set run with the KB **on** vs **off** (or vs a baseline), scored on **task success**, not retrieval position. Recall without task-lift means the KB retrieves the wrong thing well. This mirrors how mature agent harnesses gate on outcome rather than retrieval — GAIA2 (pass@1 against a write-action verifier), SWE-bench (fail-to-pass test execution), τ-bench (grounded end-state diff) — and π-Bench's practice of scoring "used the right context" as an axis distinct from "task completed." A companion generation check, **faithfulness** (fraction of the answer's claims actually supported by the retrieved chunk; RAGAS, reference-free), guards against a cited-but-unsupported answer.

### Query classes the golden set must cover

A clean teach→recall set overstates quality: memory/KB systems break on the *hard* classes. The set must enumerate them explicitly (taxonomy adapted from the LobsterAIAgent memory harness and LongMemEval):

- **Clean-fact recall** — baseline single-hop lookup.
- **Multi-hop** — the answer requires joining two or more chunks (the entity graph's reason to exist, §4).
- **Time-bound / freshness** — a fact true only "as of" a date; the correct *version* must win.
- **Correction** — a later chunk fixes an earlier stated fact; the corrected value must be surfaced.
- **Contradiction** — two chunks conflict; retrieval must surface the conflict, not silently pick one.
- **Retraction** — a withdrawn fact must stop being recalled.
- **Reinforcement / corroboration** — repeated independent sources should raise confidence, not merely duplicate.
- **Hypothetical-exclusion** — speculative or conditional statements must NOT return as settled fact.
- **Abstention** — when the answer is genuinely absent, retrieval should return nothing above the score floor rather than a false near-match (LongMemEval scores this explicitly).
- **Citation-fidelity** — the returned chunk must actually support the claim it is cited for (§4, "Citation enrichment").

### What is measured today

The code computes and floors a retrieval **score**, but no Tier-1/Tier-2 metric and none of the hard query classes above:

- `HybridRetriever.search` fuses the keyword + graph + vector legs by RRF (`_rrf_fuse`, k=60; vector leg weighted `VECTOR_RRF_WEIGHT = 2.0`), tie-broken by `updated_at` recency — a secondary sort key, **not** a decay weight (`retrieval.py`, §4). The keyword leg's rank-1 hit is protected from truncation: when fusion pushes it past `limit`, `search` appends it as one extra trailing row, so a response may carry `limit + 1` rows.
- Results below `min_score = 0.012` are dropped by the tool caller (`mcp_tools/knowledge.py`), not inside the retriever.
- `kirocrew eval` ships four scenarios (`smoke_test`, `memory_recall_basic`, `lesson_application`, `context_accumulation`) scored per-assertion (`contains` / `regex` / `judge`) with an optional 1–5 LLM judge (`eval/judge.py`, pass ≥ 3.0). All four are clean single-fact teach→recall or accumulate→summarize flows; none exercises correction / contradiction / retraction / time-bound / reinforcement / hypothetical, and none reports recall@k, MRR, or task-lift.

- `kirocrew bench kb-retrieval` is the Tier-1 ruler: it scores a frozen golden set (`eval/bench/data/kb_golden_v2.json`, hand-authored, covering the query classes above) against a real `KnowledgeStore` + `HybridRetriever` and reports recall@k / MRR@k / nDCG@k per class, plus `abstention_rate`. The default toy embedder is a deterministic plumbing check; `--no-embeddings` isolates the keyword/graph legs, while `--real-embedder` waits for a cold local model to finish loading before it records a semantic score. It measures **bare `HybridRetriever.search`** — the tool-caller `min_score` floor above is deliberately not applied — so its numbers describe the raw retriever, not the agent-visible MCP surface; a floor change at the tool caller will not move them.

- The default golden set is **v2** (68 docs / 46 queries). v1 (18 / 12) is still packaged so archived v1 reports stay reproducible, but it could not discriminate: every class scored 1.000 recall under both a keyword-only and a semantic retriever, because each gold document was the only one in the corpus using its topic's vocabulary, so matching one term was enough to win. v2 adds competing distractors — same-topic documents that differ on the decisive attribute (a different service, environment, cache, or time window) — and the legs then separate. Keyword-only is deterministic (FTS5 + graph, no model) and reproducible: nDCG@3 0.825 / MRR@3 0.804. The semantic leg measured with `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` gives nDCG@3 0.903 / MRR@3 0.887 — re-measure rather than trust that pair after a model or quantization change, since it moves with both. The coarse separations are the stable evidence: `multi_hop` recall_all@3 0.400 keyword versus 1.000 semantic, and at k=1 neither leg is saturated (recall_any@1 0.650 versus 0.775), which is what makes that cut-off informative. `abstention_rate` is now measured over 6 queries rather than 1; it still reads 0.000 because bare `HybridRetriever.search` has no score floor, so the store never abstains. **A v1 report and a v2 report measure different corpora and must not be differenced** — and nothing mechanical stops it: `bench kb-retrieval` prints its report and writes no file (it has no `--out-dir`), while `bench compare` only diffs saved memory-retrieval reports and never sees a KB run. The one guard is the corpus name in the printed header (`KB retrieval eval: kb_golden_v2`), so read that before comparing two of these numbers.

The remaining gap is therefore an **A/B task-lift harness** (Tier 2), plus a floor-aware variant of the Tier-1 ruler if the agent-visible surface is ever to be scored directly — the precondition for tuning recency, adding a reranker, or content-typed TTL against evidence rather than intuition.

## Constants

| Constant | Value | Location | Purpose |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| `FileReader.SUPPORTED` | see below | `readers.py` | Extensions the watcher/reader will ingest |
| `DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE` | `3` | `llm_pool.py` | Worker count in a pool |
| `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` | `60.0` | `llm_pool.py` | Per-message worker timeout (extraction) |

| `_LARGE_REBUILD_WARN_THRESHOLD` | `1000` | `watcher.py` | Stale-item count at which the self-heal rebuild logs a prominent WARNING (usually an embedder-sig change invalidating the whole corpus) |

`VECTOR_RRF_WEIGHT` has a consequence worth naming here: because the vector leg outweighs the keyword leg, a document only the keyword leg found can be truncated away by fusion even when it is the single right answer. `HybridRetriever.search` compensates by **appending** that document (§4, "RRF fusion") rather than by retuning the weight — no weight setting both keeps semantic dominance and keeps the literal match.

## 1. FileReader & supported formats (`readers.py`)

`FileReader.read(path)` returns `(text, meta)`. It first refuses sensitive paths — `is_sensitive_path(path)` raises `PermissionError("Refusing to read sensitive path: …")` before any open — then dispatches by lower-cased extension.

`FileReader.SUPPORTED` (`readers.py`) is the ingestion allowlist:

```
'', '.md', '.txt', '.org', '.py', '.java', '.ts', '.js', '.rs', '.go',
'.html', '.htm', '.docx', '.pdf',
'.csv', '.log', '.json', '.jsonl', '.ndjson', '.yaml', '.yml', '.sh', '.rb', '.ps1', '.psm1', '.psd1', '.c', '.cpp', '.h',
'.cs', '.kt', '.kts', '.swift', '.scala'
```

It includes markdown/plain-text (`.md`/`.txt`/`.org`), source-code extensions, and the two binary formats with declared optional deps (`.pdf` → pdfplumber, `.docx` → python-docx).

**`SUPPORTED` must be a superset of `ingestion.CODE_EXTS`.** The two sets are hand-maintained and overlap: `SUPPORTED` gates the folder scan (`folder_watcher._walk`, and a source's `include_extensions` can only narrow it), while `CODE_EXTS` picks the code-aware chunker. A code extension present in `CODE_EXTS` but absent from `SUPPORTED` is therefore skipped before any reader runs — a folder source over such a repo ingests only its README and config, with no error. `test/test_knowledge.py` pins the subset relation so the two cannot drift again.

**Dispatch (`_DISPATCH`, `readers.py`)** routes only `.pdf`/`.pptx`/`.docx`/`.html`/`.htm` to specialized readers. Anything else — including `.org`, `.txt`, `.md`, and every source-code extension — falls through to the generic `_read_text` path and into the generic chunker downstream. So `.org` is treated as plain text; there is no Org-mode-specific parser. Text decoding (shared by `_read_text` and `_read_html` via `_decode_text_bytes`) is a single-open buffer decode: BOM-sniffed UTF-16 LE/BE first, otherwise UTF-8 with a latin-1 fallback. The UTF-16 branch is extension-agnostic — any text format arriving as BOM'd UTF-16 decodes correctly, not only the PowerShell files (Windows tooling writes UTF-16LE) that motivated it.

**`.pptx` is intentionally out of `SUPPORTED`** even though `_read_pptx` exists: python-pptx is not declared in `setup.cfg`, so the format is kept off the allowlist (the comment at `readers.py` documents this). Reachable only if `.pptx` were re-added to `SUPPORTED`.

**Binary/optional-dep readers** degrade gracefully — a missing optional import returns an `{'format': 'error'}` meta with an install hint rather than raising:
- `_read_pdf` — pdfplumber; concatenates per-page `extract_text()`, records `page_count`,
  and releases each page immediately after extraction so its parsed-layout cache does not
  remain resident until the whole document closes (`Page.close()` when available, with
  `flush_cache()` compatibility for pdfplumber 0.10).
- `_read_docx` — python-docx; converts `Heading N` paragraph styles to `#`-prefixed markdown (`content_type: 'markdown'`), records `paragraph_count`.
- `_read_html` — html2text when importable (`ignore_images=True`, `ignore_links=False`); otherwise a regex fallback strips `<script>`/`<style>` and tags.

Base metadata always carries `format`, `title` (file stem), `file_size`, `extension`, and a computed `line_count`.

## 2. Folder discovery & scan (`folder_watcher.py`)

**Namespace routing**: folder/vault sources read their target namespace from `properties["namespace"]` (default `"default"`). The `add_source` handler accepts namespace either as a top-level body field or inside `properties`; a top-level `namespace` is folded into `properties` (if dict and not already set) before storage. This ensures FolderWatcher and Watcher resolve the correct namespace at scan time via `props.get("namespace", "default")`.
`FolderWatcher.scan_source(source)` scans a folder-type source under a per-`source_id` `asyncio.Lock` (one scan per source at a time) and returns `{new, changed, deleted, skipped, capped, failed}`.

**`_walk(root, ignore_patterns, extra_skip_dirs)`** (run via `asyncio.to_thread`) is the discovery step:
- Prunes `HARD_SKIP_DIRS`, any per-source-type extra skip dirs (`SOURCE_TYPE_SKIP_DIRS["obsidian_vault"] = {.obsidian, .trash}`), and **all** dotfiles/dot-dirs in place during `os.walk`. Build-output trees are in `HARD_SKIP_DIRS` because a rebuild presents hundreds of regenerated files as changed content; `cdk.out` (AWS CDK synth output) needs its own entry because its name only *contains* a dot, so the dot-prefix rule never prunes it.
- Skips files that are never documents by case-insensitive basename match against `DEFAULT_IGNORE_GLOBS`. Two classes:
  - OS junk / editor and Office lock files (macOS AppleDouble `._*`, `.ds_store`, Office `~$*`, LibreOffice `.~lock.*`, `thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `*.tmp`, editor swap/backup, partial downloads). A discovered-but-unreadable file carrying a supported extension fails ingestion, is never auto-retried, and would leave a source permanently stalled below 100%.
  - Dependency lock files (`package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, `bun.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `pipfile.lock`, `cargo.lock`, `gemfile.lock`, `composer.lock`, `packages.lock.json`, `gradle.lockfile`, `flake.lock`). These ingest successfully, which is the problem: they are large machine-generated resolution output, each chunk costs one extraction call, and regenerating one bills it again on the next sweep.
- Applies the source's `ignore_patterns` (fnmatch against the relative path).
- **`.kiroignore` (`kiroignore.py`)**: when the SOURCE ROOT holds a `.kiroignore`, its rules are compiled once per sweep and applied on top of everything above. Matching **directories are pruned in place** during `os.walk`, so a generated tree (`cdk.out`, coverage output) is never descended rather than filtered file by file. The rule file itself is never indexed — its extensionless name is in `FileReader.SUPPORTED`, so it would otherwise be ingested as a document.
  - Syntax is a documented SUBSET of gitignore: `#` comments, blank lines, trailing `/` (directories only), leading `/` (root-anchored), any other embedded `/` (also anchored; a separator-free pattern matches that basename at any depth), `*` / `?` / `**`, and `!` negation where the last matching rule wins. NOT supported: `[a-z]` character classes (brackets match literally), backslash escapes other than a leading `\#` / `\!`, nested `.kiroignore` files in subdirectories, and re-including a path underneath an excluded directory (as in git).
  - **Defensive by contract**: the file is user-authored and re-read every sweep, so an unreadable, oversized (> `MAX_FILE_BYTES` = 64 KiB) or undecodable one degrades to "no extra exclusions" and never raises mid-scan; a single unusable pattern is dropped and the rest of the file still applies. Rules are capped at `MAX_RULES` = 1000.
  - **`.gitignore` is deliberately NOT read as a fallback.** A scan treats a file that stops being discovered as DELETED and archives its items (`_handle_deleted`), so honouring `.gitignore` implicitly would, on the next sweep, drop already-indexed documents out of every existing folder source whose root happens to be a repository. Creating a `.kiroignore` is an explicit act, so the same removal is the user's intent.
- **Extension filter**: keeps a file only if its lower-cased suffix is in `FileReader.SUPPORTED` **or** equals `.canvas` (Obsidian canvas files).
- **Sensitive-path guard**: resolves each candidate (`Path.resolve()`) and skips it if `is_sensitive_path()` matches.
- Returns `[(full_path, mtime)]`.

**Scan bookkeeping (`_do_scan`)**:
- **Embedding attendance is call-scoped.** Scheduled `KnowledgeWatcher` folder and
  single-file re-ingest pass `PRIORITY_BULK` through `FolderWatcher` and
  `IngestionPipeline`, so background work uses the reduced bulk inference pool.
  Dashboard/manual `scan_source` and `ingest_file` calls omit the argument and retain
  `PRIORITY_NORMAL`. The priority is never stored on the shared pipeline, so a
  concurrent attended ingest cannot be downgraded by a watcher sweep.
- Discovered files above `props["max_files"]` (default `DEFAULT_MAX_FILES` = 5000) are capped **newest-first** (sort by mtime desc); the surplus count is reported as `capped`.
- Deletion detection uses the **full** discovered set (pre-cap) so capping never triggers false deletions; a vanished file's items are archived via `_handle_deleted` → `store.delete_items_batch`.
- Change detection is mtime-then-content-hash: unchanged mtime → `last_seen` bump only; changed mtime but identical SHA-256 → state refresh, no re-ingest.
- Batched `last_seen` flush/commit and stale-claim release run off the asyncio
  event loop; each flush and its commit stay within one worker hop so they share
  the thread-local SQLite connection.
- Per-file state lives in the `folder_file_state` table with `status` ∈ `{done, scanning, skipped, failed, deduped}`. `scanning` is written **before** ingest so a crash mid-file is recoverable; `skipped`/`failed`/`deduped` files are not auto-retried (user must retry).
- **TOCTOU defense**: `_ingest_file` re-resolves symlinks and re-checks `is_sensitive_path` at ingest time; a block writes `status='failed'` and emits an SEL `knowledge.source.file.ingest_denied` (`outcome="denied"`, `reason=sensitive_path_toctou`) audit event.
- After a successful scan, each newly ingested/changed file gets a **targeted** cross-source dedup (`dedup_document(..., apply=True)`) — O(k·n) over the k changed files rather than a full O(n²) corpus sweep — so a folder copy collapses any matching one-shot upload.
- **The dedup unit is always the DOCUMENT, never the source.** For a folder source a document is a `folder_file_state` row; for everything else it is one `content_hash` group of `items` (`enumerate_docs` groups by `(source_id, content_hash)`), so an aggregate source holding many documents (`artifact`, `agent`) dedups per document like any other. `_collapse_doc` drops the loser document's items and marks its owning state row `deduped` so nothing re-ingests it; it removes the source row only once the source is provably empty (`_source_is_now_empty`: no items, no state rows, and not a folder/vault), which is what keeps a collapsed one-shot upload from lingering as an empty row. There is no source-level unit and no carve-out for aggregate source types: a carve-out at that level would mean aggregate documents were never deduped at all.
- **Scheduled sweeps.** `KnowledgeWatcher._maybe_dedup_sweep` runs a full `dedup_sweep` every `knowledge.dedup_every_n_sweeps` sweeps (default 12, ~hourly at the 300s interval; 0 disables). The targeted per-ingest call and the pre-ingest exact-hash gate cannot catch a near-duplicate or a pre-existing one, so the periodic pass is required for duplicates to actually be collapsed.
- **One document, several locations.** A document held by two sources is ONE stored copy with a `source_locations` row per source, not two copies where one is destroyed. A collapse attaches the loser's source as a location of the winner's items, deletes the loser's redundant copy, and records `merged_into_source_id` on the loser's state row. Three consequences follow, and each closes a way the previous design lost data: `delete_source_cascade` re-points `items.source_id` to a surviving holder instead of deleting a document another source holds (`reassign_item_source` is the only path that moves ownership, since `_ITEM_COLUMNS` deliberately excludes the column); deleting the winner clears the marker so the document is ingested again rather than stranded; and "empty source" now means holding nothing by location either, in both the dedup check and the boot-time orphan sweep, because reaping a source would delete the very rows recording co-ownership. The marker names a SOURCE and never the winner's item ids: `item_ids` means "the items this row owns", and dedup derives a document's hash and embedding from whatever it points at, so a row naming the winner's items would be enumerated as a second document over one physical item set — and collapsing that pair deletes the surviving copy. `_match_reason` refuses any pair whose `item_ids` overlap for the same reason. Per-source counts report what a source HOLDS, while the Library total counts documents, so a shared document is visible under both sources without inflating the total.

- **Pre-ingest duplicate gate.** `IngestionPipeline._skip_as_duplicate` refuses a write whose whole-text `content_hash` already exists in another source, on every ingest path, recording a terminal `ingestion_jobs` row with `status='skipped_duplicate'`. Refusing is not the same as doing nothing: the items the call was going to REPLACE are deleted first, because the document's content changed to something already stored elsewhere and its previous items are now superseded. Leaving them would keep the old text searchable and — since the state row is then recorded with an empty group — unreachable by the deleted-file path. A folder file refused this way is marked `deduped` rather than `done`; an artifact or agent document gets the same marker in its item-state row so the owning sync does not retry a write the gate will refuse again. The gate is not order-blind: it consults the same `PERSISTENT_SOURCE_TYPES` ranking `pick_winner` uses, so an incoming **persistent** source (folder / vault / wiki) is allowed to land when the current holder is **transient** (a one-shot upload or chat capture), and the post-ingest sweep then collapses the pair keeping the persistent copy. Refusing on arrival order alone inverted that ranking: the folder copy was marked `deduped`, the only searchable copy stayed inside the upload, and deleting the upload left none. Equal rank still refuses, which is the cheap path — it skips the chunking and extraction the sweep would immediately undo. Exact-hash only — the fuzzy tier needs embeddings and cannot run inline. The whole gate is ONE `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction that re-reads the holder **under the write lock** and declines to dedupe when it is gone (a cheap unlocked probe runs first so the common not-a-duplicate answer does not serialize every ingest): it makes the incoming source DEPEND on the holder, so a concurrent `delete_source_cascade` must not cascade that copy away in between. The scan's terminal `deduped` write (`FolderWatcher._record_deduped_state`) takes the same lock and derives the file's item group from **its own row** instead of assuming it empty, because a cascade landing after the gate committed reassigns the surviving item to this source and can adopt it into that row; predicting `[]` there would erase the adoption and leave the last copy owned but named by no row — unreachable by the deleted-file path and undeletable. The derivation is row-scoped, never by `(source_id, content_hash)`: two documents in one source may legitimately hold identical text, and a hash-scoped read would name one physical item into both rows, destroying it on the first delete of either. **All three doc-state tables do this**, through the one primitive `KnowledgeStore.surviving_group_in_txn(table, source_id, key)` — `folder_file_state` keyed by `file_path`, `artifact_item_state` and `agent_item_state` by `slug` (`_DOC_STATE_KEY_COL`). An aggregate row that ends up owning items is written `active`, not `deduped`, because `find_document_by_hash` only matches `active` and a row owning content while reporting `deduped` would let the same text in again under a second slug. Every one of the three takes `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and therefore runs off the event loop through `run_to_completion`; `test_deduped_state_writes_are_never_called_on_the_event_loop` is the ratchet. **Known gap, pre-existing and folder-only:** for a transformed file (PDF/DOCX/HTML) the adoption itself matches nothing, because `_adopt_reassigned_item` keys on `COALESCE(text_hash, content_hash)` and a refused folder row derives `text_hash` from a byte-identical sibling row it may not have — so nothing lands in the row for the terminal write to preserve. The aggregate tables store the text hash in `content_hash` directly and are unaffected. Closing it needs the incoming document's text hash carried out of the gate rather than derived from a sibling.
- **Legacy items with a null `content_hash` are not exact-matchable.** The column arrived by `ALTER TABLE`, so rows written before it are null, and tier-1 requires both sides non-null — on a real Library that was 435 of 526 folder items. Those documents reach de-duplication only through the filename+embedding tier. Backfilling is NOT done here: the extracted text is not retained, so the pipeline's hash cannot be reproduced, and any derived value has to be grouped per DOCUMENT (`folder_file_state` / item-state rows) rather than per source — grouping by source gives every file in a folder one identical key, which the sweep then reads as an exact match and collapses. What IS enforced is that every ingest path stamps the column, asserted by test, so the gap cannot grow.

## 2b. The agent's write path (`agent_source.py`)

One path adds documents without the user registering a source by hand, and it is the
agent's: the `knowledge_add_document` MCP tool, gated off by default on
`knowledge.auto_add_documents`. **Nothing registers a file or folder on its own.**

**No auto-registration of any kind.** There is no workspace drop folder, no
per-project document discovery, and no config key that turns either on. Such a path
would register directories the user never named and spend LLM extraction on them with
no confirmation step, which is the property ruled out here — an opt-in default does not
make it acceptable. A folder enters the Library exactly one way: the user adds it and
confirms it. See `docs/system-specs/post-launch-removals.md`.

The per-folder safety properties are generic and reachable from any hand-added source:
`confine_to_root` (a file whose resolved path lands outside the registered root is
skipped — `os.walk` does not descend a directory symlink, but a file symlink IS
followed on open), the `max_files` cap, and `folder_chunk_budget` pacing.

**Agent-added documents (`agent_source.py`).** The `knowledge_add_document` MCP tool
lands documents in one aggregate `agent://` source named "Auto-added", with per-document
groups in `agent_item_state` keyed by a slug derived from the document's `source_uri` and
never from its content, so an edit replaces the group rather than accumulating copies. The
identity must not be the title alone: two unrelated documents are both routinely called
"README", and since a matching key means "same document, replace it", a title-keyed group
lets the second add delete the first document's items. It routes
through `IngestionPipeline.ingest_file` — one ingestion path — and content and title are
redacted before they cross into the store. Adds are serialised by a module lock, because
new items are attributed to a document by diffing the source's item ids around the
ingest.

**Ownership is recorded from inside the ingest, not after it returns.** The items become
durable during `ingest_file`; `ingest_file` therefore takes an `on_committed` callback and
invokes it in its finalize hop, on the success branch, right after the superseded group is
deleted. The ids it hands over are **collected at each `add_item`**, not inferred from a
before/after comparison of the source: `import_bundle` writes into the same aggregate in
its own transaction and under no shared lock, so a comparison would attribute anything it
committed meanwhile to whichever document happened to be ingesting — giving that document
delete authority over knowledge it never created, and destroying it on the next edit. Writing the group
afterwards instead would leave several awaits — the temp-file cleanup, the job-status read
— between the items existing and the record that makes them replaceable, and each is a
cancellation point on the gateway loop. Interrupted there, nothing names the items, and
**both** of the aggregate's duplicate defences read that same row: `get_state` reports no
previous group, so the next add replaces nothing and `find_document_by_hash` cannot see
the content either. The document is then stored twice, and because replacement is what
carries delete authority, an edited re-add leaves the superseded version searchable
permanently. Running inside the hop gives the ownership write the same run-to-completion
guarantee as the delete it belongs with. The `deduped` marker is written by the caller
instead, because the duplicate gate returns before the hop ever runs.

The tool takes the document TEXT and **never opens a file**. A path opened here on
behalf of whatever supplied it is exactly the case where a component can be swapped for a
link to a credential file between the check and the open, and a path pointing at a binary
crashes the decode. Text the agent has already read carries no such window: it was read
through the agent's own file tools, under their approval and audit. Documents that
arrive fetched are text to begin with, and documents in the user's project reach the
Library through a folder source the user registers, which scans through the guarded
folder path.

`source_uri` is an **opaque identity label**, not a read instruction: it is redacted,
capped, stored and hashed, and never opened, resolved, stat-ed or fetched. It is
**required**, because a title does not identify a document. The identity is hashed from
the RAW uri while only the redacted form is stored or audited — redaction is lossy, so two
uris differing only in a same-length credential-shaped segment reduce to the same string,
and hashing that would merge two documents into one group. A caller needing the bytes at
that location reads them itself and passes `content`.

This replaces the never-built server-side doc-link scanner. Rather than Kiro Crew
regex-matching links in chat and fetching them unattended, the agent reads the document
with its own tools under its own approval and hands over text. Kiro Crew fetches nothing,
so `knowledge.doc_ingest_hosts` — whose default is `[]` = deny-all — must NOT gate this
path, or the feature would ingest nothing on a default config while its toggle read on.

**Chunk budget.** `folder_watcher._do_scan` orders discovered files newest-first
unconditionally and stops once a sweep has ingested its budget of chunks. Files not
reached keep (or lack) their `folder_file_state` row, so the next sweep resumes from
them — the existing `status` column already carries the resume point. Every folder
source is budgeted by `knowledge.folder_ingest_chunk_budget` (resolved by
`folder_watcher.folder_chunk_budget`, overridable per source via a `chunk_budget`
property, 0 = unbounded), capped in turn by the watcher's global
`knowledge.sweep_chunk_budget`. A folder still gets ingested in full; the budget only
decides how fast. It applies to the confirm- and resume-triggered scans as well as the sweep,
because the confirm scan is the largest burst — nothing is ingested yet, so every
discovered file is new.

The watcher's **single-file `local_file` loop draws from the same global counter**,
and the two populations **alternate which spends the budget first** on the sweep
counter's parity — so sustained pressure from one side (a churning folder source,
or many changed single files) delays the other by at most one sweep, never
permanently. The single-file loop walks rows **least-recently-attempted first** — every served row (committed,
deduped, oversized, or failed) stamps `sweep_attempted_at` into its properties and
rotates to the back, with `last_synced` as the fallback key for never-served rows —
so under sustained contention every source makes progress and a persistently
failing row cannot hold the front of the order while its charged attempts consume
the budget. It checks the remaining
`sweep_chunk_budget` allowance per row and charges back the
**attempted** chunk total the pipeline's `on_progress` callback reports for the
`extracting` phase — the calls the budget meters are extraction calls, and they are
spent whether or not the write later commits, so a rolled-back partial ingest still
charges (never a `get_job_status` read-back, which is blocking SQLite on the event
loop). The gate sits below the existence check and defers with a per-row `continue`
rather than the folder loop's `break`, so zero-cost `sync_status` upkeep (the
'missing' marker) still lands on a sweep whose folder sources spent the whole
budget. A deferred row's `mtime`/`content_hash` stay unrecorded so the next sweep
resumes from it. Terminal outcomes are latched from the pipeline's `on_committed`
(fully committed) and `on_duplicate` (pre-ingest gate refusal) callbacks: only those
persist bookkeeping, so a rolled-back partial ingest stays retryable — bounded by
the attempted-charge above — instead of being parked behind a recorded hash while
the superseded document stays searchable.

**Explicit-import chunk ceiling.** Every budget above governs a WATCHER sweep. The
explicit one-shot import routes reach `IngestionPipeline` directly and no sweep
counter ever sees them, so they carry their own cross-file ceiling:
`ImportChunkBudget` in `ingestion.py`, sized by `knowledge.import_chunk_budget`
(0 = disabled, the default) over a rolling `_IMPORT_CHUNK_BUDGET_WINDOW_SECS`
window. A single file is already capped at `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE`; this bounds the
cost ACROSS files, which is the shape a run of deliberate adds has.

*Counted by default, exempt only where something else bounds it.* The opt-out is
`ingest_file`'s `count_toward_import_budget`, defaulting to `True`, so a new caller
is counted unless it asks not to be. `ingest_text` carries no such flag: only the
sweeps opt out, and none of them reach it. Read that default as the rule and this
list as its only exceptions -- a new path (a new connector, say) inherits the
ceiling deliberately rather than by forgetting a keyword:

| Path | Counted? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| dashboard single-file add, multipart upload, agent `knowledge_add_document`, direct text ingest, remote connector sync | yes | no other counter sees them |
| auto-research add-to-knowledge | yes | a user's click with no bound of its own |
| folder-watcher sweeps, single-file sweep | no | bounded by `sweep_chunk_budget` / `folder_ingest_chunk_budget` above |
| artifact-sync reconcile | no | bounded per reconcile by `RECONCILE_INGEST_BUDGET` |

*Reserve / settle / release.* The true chunk count is unknown until after an await,
so `reserve()` books `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_FILE` as a placeholder INTO the window at
admission, and every concurrent `reserve` sees it -- without that, N simultaneous
imports would each pass before any recorded. `settle(token, n)` reconciles it down
to the real count once the fallible finalize has succeeded, keeping the RESERVATION
timestamp so the window expires the cost from when the import began; `release` in a
`finally` reclaims a token on every non-settling exit, including the no-op success
paths (content-hash unchanged, dedup-refused) that would otherwise strand a
placeholder. An OPEN reservation is exempt from window pruning, so an import slower
than the window cannot age out of the ceiling it occupies while it is still running.
Trip behaviour is a reasoned refusal, never truncation: `ImportChunkBudgetError`
carries budget, window and spend.

*Admission before acceptance.* A route that answers the client and ingests
afterwards cannot discover a refusal in its background task -- the multipart upload
route's staged temp file is the only server-side copy, so a late refusal would
discard a file the client was told had been accepted. Such a caller reserves with
`reserve_import_budget()` before responding, answers `429` on refusal, and passes
the token to `ingest_file` with `count_toward_import_budget=False`. That flag is
required, not decorative: a disabled budget admits with a token of `None`, so
leaving the flag `True` would re-enter the budget on a second config read.
`release_import_budget` reclaims a token the caller never handed over.

**Cost visibility.** `POST /api/knowledge/sources` walks a folder before ingesting
anything and returns `file_count`, `capped_file_count`, `estimated_chunks`,
`estimated_llm_calls` and `chunk_budget_per_sweep` alongside the
`pending_confirmation` status. The walk uses `folder_watcher.walk_filters`, the same
filter set the sweep applies, so the count describes the files that would actually be
ingested. The chunk figure is derived from the chunker's target size and file bytes
(`_estimated_chunks`), never measured: it exists to show order of magnitude before the
user confirms, and no code path treats it as a bound.

## 3. LLMPool workers (`llm_pool.py`)

Both entity extraction (`EntityExtractor`) and internal-URL fetch (`agent_fetch.fetch_url_content`) acquire workers from a shared `LLMPool` — a provider-agnostic, bounded pool (`DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE` = 3) of **long-lived** ACP workers. A `Worker` ABC has two concrete paths:

- **Default (kiro-cli)** — `AcpWorker` drives the `kirocrew-knowledge` agent over ACP (`AGENT_NAME`). That agent is installed by `agent.py:_install_knowledge_agent` (model `claude-haiku-4.5`, kirocrew-core tools only — no internal MCP wiring in the OSS fork).
- **`agent.provider="claude_code"` (legacy seam)** — `CCWorker` drives a long-lived `claude` CLI subprocess over stream-json I/O (haiku model, `bypassPermissions`); URL-fetch tools are opt-in via `KIROCREW_KNOWLEDGE_FETCH_TOOLS`. KiroCrew's provider enum is `["acp"]`, so this branch is dormant in practice.

### Sweep shielding + audit source

`AcpWorker.start()` wires two protections that matter for a long-lived pool worker (`llm_pool.py`):

- **Sweep shielding via `register_protected_pid`** — pool workers are direct `AcpClient` sessions, **not** `SessionMap` sessions or warm-pool providers, so the gateway's periodic orphan sweep cannot see them via `_collect_active_pids` and would SIGKILL a *busy* worker mid-task (surfacing as `ACP process exited (code=1)`). After `ensure_ready()`, `AcpWorker` registers the worker's kiro-cli PID in the sweep-protected set via `register_protected_pid` (`session_pid.py`), and unregisters it in `shutdown()` and on respawn — so the orphan sweep treats it like a live session (the same `register_protected_pid` mechanism the shared `WorkerPool` engine in `acp/worker_pool.py` applies to `ReviewPool`'s `AcpReviewWorker`).
- **`audit_source="subagent"`** — pool workers run tools without passing through `chat_runner` or `SubagentManager`, so their tool calls would otherwise never reach the security audit log. With `audit_source` set, `AcpClient` emits an SEL `log_tool_invocation` record (`source="subagent"`, `outcome="auto_approved"`) per auto-approved tool call; the emit is offloaded to `subprocess_executor()` and bounded by `asyncio.wait_for` so a hung SEL backend never stalls tool dispatch. `None` (chat/subagent clients) never double-logs.

### Sandbox parity

`_get_sandbox_mode()` reads `agent.sandbox` (default `"off"` → defers isolation to kiro-cli's internal agent sandbox; set `"auto"` for standard OS-level confinement). It distinguishes two fallback cases so a config error can never silently disable sandboxing: an **absent** value defaults to `"off"` (the intended default), while a **present but unrecognised** value falls back to `"auto"` (fail-secure) rather than reaching `wrap_argv` as an unknown mode. Knowledge workers honour the same `agent.sandbox` setting as chat/Slack providers (parity), so the default flows through here too.

### Pool mechanics

`LLMPool.start()` reads config once off the event loop and spawns all workers; `acquire()` blocks on a semaphore when all workers are busy and transparently replaces a dead worker (`is_alive()` false) on acquire. `send()` is the acquire→send→release convenience; `send_batch()` runs prompts concurrently bounded by pool size. A failed spawn during `start()` tears down all already-started workers.

**Untrusted-chunk delimiters (CWE-94).** `EntityExtractor` wraps each untrusted chunk in **per-request nonce-suffixed** delimiters (`<<<BEGIN_UNTRUSTED_CHUNK_{nonce}>>>` / `<<<END_UNTRUSTED_CHUNK_{nonce}>>>`, `nonce = uuid4().hex`), so content that embeds a legacy static delimiter cannot forge the boundary and inject instructions. Both `extract` (single) and `extract_batch` (the ingestion path) apply this, and the batch path mints a **distinct nonce per chunk**.

## 4. FTS5 + graph + vector retrieval (`retrieval.py`, `store.py`)

`HybridRetriever.search(query, limit)` runs three legs and fuses them with Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

**Store (`KnowledgeStore`, `store.py`)** — SQLite (prefers `pysqlite3`, falls back to stdlib `sqlite3`), WAL journal, `foreign_keys=ON`. Items live in `items` (with an `embedding BLOB` and `status`), keyword search is served by the FTS5 virtual table `items_fts(title, content, tags, content=items, content_rowid=rowid)`, and the entity graph is an in-memory `SimpleDiGraph` (a minimal networkx-free replacement). The store keeps `items_fts` in sync on every insert/update/delete of the FTS-backed columns.

- **Keyword leg (`_keyword_search`)** — FTS5 `MATCH` over `items_fts`, ordered by `rank`. `_sanitize_fts5_query` double-quotes each token (doubling internal quotes) so user input never contributes FTS5 operators (parameterized quoting), drops `_STOPWORDS`, and OR-joins the remainder so a natural-language query no longer requires every literal token to match. An all-stopword query falls back to the raw tokens rather than dropping the leg.

- **CJK recall (`fts5_segment_for_index` + `fts5_cjk_match_groups`, `_sqlite_compat.py`)** — FTS5's `unicode61` tokenizer classifies CJK ideographs as letters, so it stores an entire spaceless run as ONE token: a whole clause becomes a single term and no query can address a word inside it. Both sides used to tokenize that way and therefore agreed, which is why the recall loss was invisible — the vector leg rescued the result set. The **index copy** of `title`/`content`/`tags` is now written with a boundary around each CJK character, so the tokenizer emits one term per character; a **query** run expands to its overlapping adjacent-character pairs as FTS5 phrases, OR-ed. A phrase over per-character terms is exact substring matching, so a four-character query for "memory leak" matches both a document spelling the run verbatim and one spelling "memory" and "leak" apart, while a document that merely reuses those characters in other words ("internal", "to save", "relief valve", "water leak") is excluded — the same adjacency floor the session search applies (`history.md`). Non-CJK input produces byte-identical text and the byte-identical expression `fts5_quote_tokens` produced, so Latin matching is unchanged; a token mixing Latin and CJK ANDs its runs. Hangul is deliberately excluded, because modern Korean is space-separated.
  - Only the index copy is transformed. `items_fts` is an external-content table (`content=items`), so `snippet()`/`highlight()` and every read of the item still see the original text.
  - **Every** writer must route through `KnowledgeStore._fts_index` / `_fts_unindex`, which write in the representation the database currently declares (`_fts_terms_segmented`, read from `user_version`). FTS5's `'delete'` command subtracts the exact terms it is handed, so the wrong representation either leaves the old terms in place — serving deleted or superseded content as live hits, which `'integrity-check'` does **not** flag — or raises `database disk image is malformed` outright. Unconditional segmentation is not available because a legacy database has writers that run before any reader can migrate it: the orphan reclaim in `_migrate` (inside the constructor) and the startup watcher sweep. The declaration is latched only in the True direction, since `user_version` only increases and another process on the same database may migrate it at any time — a cached False would keep writing raw terms into a migrated index.
  - **The declaration is serialized by SQLite's writer lock, not a Python one.** Every FTS-touching transaction is `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so a reader of the declaration already excludes the rebuild that can change it — across processes as well as threads, which a Python lock cannot do. The FTS write path therefore takes **no** Python lock: taking one there inverts against SQLite's, because a writer holding SQLite's lock would wait on Python's while the rebuilding reader holds Python's and waits on SQLite's — a deadlock that resolves only when `busy_timeout` expires, returning 500 from an event-loop write. The surviving `_fts_lock` guards the rebuild alone (so two reader threads in one process do not both start one) and is always acquired *before* SQLite's, never after.
  - There are exactly **three** FTS readers, and each calls `ensure_fts_index_current` first: `KnowledgeStore.search_items_fts`, `HybridRetriever._keyword_search`, and the dashboard's entity-items lookup (`_entity_items_rows`). The last builds its own query and matches the name as ONE phrase over the segmented text, which is what an entity name is — a contiguous string, not a bag of words. For a name with no CJK that is byte-identical to quoting the name directly, so a multi-word ASCII entity (`New York`) still requires those words adjacent; for a CJK name the segmentation is what lets the phrase address the characters the index stores. It runs under `asyncio.to_thread`, like the other knowledge readers in that module.
  - The term representation is versioned by `FTS_INDEX_VERSION` and `PRAGMA user_version`, not by a schema probe: the `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE` text is identical before and after, so nothing in the schema records which representation a database holds. `_migrate_fts_index` rebuilds in batches of `_FTS_REBUILD_BATCH` and bumps the marker only after the whole rebuild commits, so an interrupted rebuild restarts on the next open rather than resting half-built.
  - **The migration is one-way, and downgrading needs the index rebuilt.** A build from before this change knows nothing about `user_version`, so it writes and deletes raw terms against an already-segmented index — which by the rule above either leaves stale terms behind or raises `database disk image is malformed`, and the old code has no rebuild path to recover. Rolling back past this change therefore requires dropping and recreating `items_fts` (or deleting `knowledge.db`, which is a derived cache of ingested sources). Forward upgrades need nothing: the first search migrates.
  - **The rebuild is triggered by readers, never by the constructor.** `KnowledgeStore.__init__` runs on the event-loop thread (`setup_knowledge_routes` reads the lazy `state.knowledge_store` property during dashboard startup), while its FTS readers run on worker threads (`run_in_embed_pool` / `asyncio.to_thread`) — the store's own threading contract, and why it hands each thread its own connection. A data-scaled reindex in `__init__` would therefore stall the gateway at boot for the length of a full reindex: measured at 4,000 CJK items it is ~137 ms of work, and it grows linearly with the corpus. `ensure_fts_index_current` moves that cost onto the first search instead; it is lock-guarded so concurrent readers wait rather than each starting a rebuild, and steady state is a single boolean check (~1 us).
  - **Known limitation:** `add_item` persists tags with `json.dumps` at its default `ensure_ascii=True`, so a CJK tag is stored with its characters backslash-escaped and reaches the index as terms like `u6a21`/`u578b`. A CJK tag is unsearchable for that reason, which no query-side change can reach.
- **Graph leg (`_graph_search`)** — resolves query words and adjacent word-pairs to entities, expands via graph neighbors (depth 2), and ranks items by mention count. A spaceless CJK run is one whitespace word but several entity names, so an entity named for a word *inside* the run is unreachable by the split alone; `_cjk_subruns` adds the run's own contiguous CJK substrings as extra candidates, longest first (so the most specific entity name is tried before a shorter prefix of it) and bounded by `_CJK_SUBRUN_MAX_LEN` / `_CJK_SUBRUN_MAX_CANDIDATES`, since each candidate costs a `find_entity` query. This is the second of the three whitespace-splitting sites issue #3691 enumerates; a query with no CJK gets exactly the candidate list it did before.
- **Vector leg (`_vector_search`)** — brute-force cosine over `items` with `embedding IS NOT NULL AND status='active'`; returns `None` when no embedder is wired. Items whose stored embedding dimension differs from the query vector are **skipped** (not scored 0.0), with a single per-search WARNING so a model swap / stale index surfaces as "re-index needed". `_cosine_similarity` returns 0.0 for differing-length or zero vectors.
- **RRF fusion (`_rrf_fuse`, k=60)** — per-leg weights align positionally with `(keyword, graph, vector) = (1.0, 1.0, VECTOR_RRF_WEIGHT=2.0)` so semantically-strong matches dominate when the keyword leg returns literal junk. Results are tie-broken by recency (`updated_at`), and each result's `match_type` records which legs it appeared in (`keyword+graph+vector`).
  - **The keyword leg's rank-1 hit is protected from truncation.** The weight above is what makes a keyword-only document losable: a query carrying an exact error string, a ticket id or a rare technical term can have its one correct document pushed past `limit` by weighted semantic neighbours, and the caller sees related-but-wrong rows with no signal that the right one was found and dropped. When that happens `search` **appends** the keyword winner as one extra trailing row, so a response may carry `limit + 1` rows. Only rank 1 is protected, and nothing already ranked is removed, reordered or demoted — the rescue can only add. The appended row carries its real fused score (the tool caller's `min_score` floor depends on it: a keyword-rank-1-only row scores `1.0 / (60 + 1) = 0.0164`, which clears `0.012`) and its normal `match_type`, and it is appended *before* the citation-enrichment passes below, so it is exactly as citable as a ranked row. A keyword hit whose item no longer resolves (a stale FTS row) adds nothing.

**Citation enrichment** — `_attach_source_locations` batch-fetches `source_locations` (adds `section_title`, `chunk_range`, `anchor`); `_attach_citation_sources` adds `source_type`/`source_name`/`source_uri` plus the most specific per-document locator: `file_path` for folder/vault sources (from `folder_file_state`), `artifact_slug`/`artifact_name` for the aggregate artifact source (deep-links `/artifacts/<slug>`). Missing/unmapped sources degrade cleanly (extra keys simply absent).

### On-loop connection guard (`on_loop_db.py`)

`KnowledgeStore.db` is the single accessor every query in the store funnels through, so it carries the runtime half of the off-loop discipline (#7078, remedy A of #3057). `OnLoopDBGuard.check()` runs at the top of the property, before the cached-connection fast path — a second query on an already-open connection must not escape it:

- **Off the loop** (worker thread, `executors.py` lane, CLI, cron, subagent) — no-op. This is the sanctioned path.
- **On the loop, strict** — raises `OnLoopStoreError`, so an un-offloaded call-site fails a test instead of shipping.
- **On the loop, otherwise** — a throttled WARNING with `stack_info` (once per 60s per guard) and the call proceeds. Production deliberately does not raise: that would convert a slow query into a failed request.

**Construction is the one vetted on-loop take** (#8231). `setup_knowledge_routes()` reads the gateway's lazy `knowledge_store` property at route registration, which `start_dashboard` runs before the socket binds — so `__init__` (schema init, migrations) runs on the loop on every launch, by the constructor's documented design. The constructor wraps exactly those calls in `OnLoopDBGuard.allow_on_loop()`, a `ContextVar`-scoped opt-out (mirroring `history.allow_on_loop_persist`) that ends with the `with` block: the six non-constructor `_load_graph()` call sites and every query path stay fully guarded, and `test_knowledge_store_onloop_db.py::TestConstructionOnLoopIsSanctioned` pins both directions. Sanctioned is not the same as free: `_migrate()` still runs an unconditional writer-locked orphan sweep here, and gating that would change *when* the writer lock is taken — with three or more processes able to reach it against the same file (gateway, `mcp-core` stdio subprocess, CLI `knowledge_dedup`) and an effective 10 s wait (`PRAGMA busy_timeout` overrides `connect(timeout=30)`), so it stays on the boot path deliberately. **The graph load does not** (#8329): `_load_graph()` full-scans `entities`/`entity_relations` and is deferred to the first graph reader via `ensure_graph_loaded`, the same shape as the FTS rebuild — measured at 2.39 s of 5.06 s total construction at 250k entities / 750k relations, and 5.12 s of 11.32 s at 500k / 1.5M, so roughly 45% of construction leaves the boot path and scales linearly with entity count.

**The deferral is only safe because the loop-thread readers offload it.** `get_entity_graph` and `get_full_graph` are `async def` and read `store.graph` on the event loop, so each calls `await asyncio.to_thread(store.ensure_graph_loaded)` before its first `.graph` touch. Without that the deferred scan would run *on the loop* after the bind — where the loop-stall watchdog is armed (`LoopStallWatchdog` is constructed and started after `_start_site`), unlike the pre-bind window, where nothing is armed and nothing is served. `allow_on_loop()` is not available for this: its contract restricts it to constructor-shaped setup paths. The `graph` property still materialises lazily as a backstop, so a reader nobody found is served a correct graph — and flagged by the on-loop guard if it is on the loop — rather than a silently empty one, which is indistinguishable from "this entity has no neighbours". `ensure_graph_loaded` is lock-guarded like `ensure_fts_index_current` so concurrent first-touch readers wait rather than each scanning. The lock is **re-entrant, and `_load_graph` acquires it too, so EVERY rebuild serializes** — not only the first. Guarding the first-touch call site alone was not enough: the six mutation-refresh sites hold no lock of their own, so a first graph GET racing a source DELETE put two threads through the rebuild at once and the loser's rows survived into a graph whose `_graph_loaded` was then set True — a flag asserting "loaded" over stale data, which is worse than an unloaded graph because the flag stops it ever being rescanned. Serializing the whole rebuild also settles *which* snapshot wins, since the `SELECT`s run after acquisition, so the rebuild that acquires last reads the freshest committed state. There is no ordering to invert against SQLite's writer lock: `_load_graph` is read-only and all six refresh sites call it after their own `COMMIT`, unlike the FTS rebuild, which takes its lock and then `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.

**The rebuild publishes a fresh object by reference swap, and multi-step readers pin one reference (#8692).** `_load_graph` builds a new `SimpleDiGraph` from the tables and assigns it to `self._graph` in one step, rather than clearing the live object and re-adding row by row. Serialization alone fixed *which* rebuild wins, but an in-place clear-then-repopulate still left the object a reader was holding momentarily empty: a reader iterating `store.graph`, or one that re-read `store.graph` across its own steps (degree ranking, then per-node attribute reads, then edges), could observe the window between the clear and the last insert and return an empty or truncated graph. Building fresh and swapping means the old object is never mutated — a reader holding it sees a complete, consistent old graph until it drops the reference, and the next read sees the complete new one. **The reader contract is therefore: capture `store.graph` once and read through that local for the whole multi-step read** — `get_full_graph`, `get_neighbors` and `get_entity_subgraph` do this, so a swap mid-read cannot mix old and new nodes. Readers hold a plain object reference, not `_graph_lock`, so a rebuild never blocks a reader or vice versa. The two incremental writers (`add_entity`, `add_entity_relation`) commit their row and then apply a single `add_node`/`add_edge` under `_graph_lock`, so a committed add always lands on the currently published graph and is never orphaned onto an object a concurrent swap is about to discard.

This complements `scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py` rather than duplicating it. The gate rejects a blocking call written *lexically* inside an `async def`; it cannot see an `async def` that reaches the store through a plain synchronous helper one frame down (`store.get_item(...)`), and no name-based AST scan can without whole-program type inference. The guard fires for every caller regardless of stack depth. `test_knowledge_store_onloop_db.py::test_static_gate_is_blind_to_that_same_call` asserts the blind spot against the real gate, so if a future gate learns to see the interprocedural form the overlap gets re-judged deliberately instead of silently.

**Strictness** comes from `strict_enabled()`, the single parser of the truthy/falsy rules, which takes the env var name as a parameter — because "strict" means "this surface is fully offloaded, so enforce it", a property of a *surface* rather than of the process. Two surfaces can sit at different stages of the same cleanup, so each gets its own switch:

| Surface | Switch | Dev mode arms strict? |
|---|---|---|
| `history.py` session mutations | `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST` | yes |
| auto_research campaigns DB | `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST` (shared default) | yes |
| knowledge store | `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_STORE` | **no** |

The knowledge store's two narrowings exist for one reason and are both temporary: it still carries recorded on-loop callers in `.github/sync-io-in-async-baseline.txt` that #7019 owns. That backlog is now **the watcher's self-heal rebuild alone** — its 2 remaining lines, which finalize the job row inline on the cancellation path where an interrupted `to_thread` could drop the write; `start_rebuild_job` sweeps a stale 'processing' row to 'abandoned', so the single-flight guard recovers either way. `dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py` takes the store through a worker for every take of its own, endpoints and background tasks alike, so the `/api/knowledge/stats` and `/api/knowledge/namespaces` handlers this paragraph used to name are no longer on the loop. The claim is scoped to that file's own takes on purpose: the connector branch of `sync_source` awaits `SyncScheduler.sync_source`, which writes the row inline from an async method, so a handler still reaches the store on the loop one frame down — interprocedural backlog the lexical baseline cannot see, and #7019's to carry. The separate switch is load-bearing because `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST` is **already exported** into the e2e gateway by `setup.py`'s `test_e2e` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, scoped when written to history's clean surface — on that switch the watcher's finalize would raise inside the e2e run. Excluding the dev-mode arm matters for the same backlog: raising on tracked work reports it as a regression, and the developer's rational response (unsetting `KIROCREW_DEV_MODE`) would silence `history.py`'s guard too. When #7019 empties that baseline, both arguments go and this store joins the shared switch — `test_knowledge_store_onloop_db.py::TestSharedSwitchCannotArmThisStore` asserts the CI export against the real workflow file, so that flip has to be deliberate.

### `local_knowledge_search` MCP tool (`mcp_core.py`)

The LLM reaches retrieval through the `kirocrew-core` MCP tool `local_knowledge_search`:
- DB path: `config_dir()/workspace/knowledge/knowledge.db`; a missing DB returns "Knowledge Library is not configured…" (SEL `not_configured`).
- `_get_knowledge_search` caches the `(KnowledgeStore, embedder)` pair across calls and rebuilds only when the knowledge DB (or its `-wal`) or `config.json` changes — avoiding the per-call schema DDL / migrate / graph-load.
- Default `limit` is 3; results below `min_score = 0.012` are dropped. The retriever may return `limit + 1` rows (the protected keyword rank-1 hit, §4) and the tool does **not** re-truncate, so the LLM can see one extra result — the `limit` property description says so. Output is run through `redact_exfiltration_urls()` + `redact_credentials()` before returning, and every call emits an SEL audit event (`success` / `no_results` / `not_configured` / `unknown_source`). Input is validated against `LOCAL_KNOWLEDGE_SEARCH_SCHEMA` (`validation.py`).
- Optional `source_id` scopes the SEED legs only (FTS5 keyword + vector similarity, via parameterized WHERE clauses in `HybridRetriever`); the graph leg stays unfiltered so cross-source entity connections still contribute traversal context. Scope membership is ownership OR location — `items.source_id` or a `source_locations` row, so an item surviving a cross-source dedup collapse still belongs to the losing source's scope (the same rule as `/api/knowledge/graph`'s filter). Omitting it keeps the unscoped behavior. A nonexistent id returns a guidance message naming `knowledge_list_sources` (SEL `unknown_source`), not an exception.
- The companion tool `knowledge_list_sources` (no arguments; `KNOWLEDGE_LIST_SOURCES_SCHEMA`) opens with one `Knowledge library: N source(s), N document(s), N item(s).` totals line from `store.aggregate_stats()`, then one `name — id (N item(s))` line per source, counting **active** items only (superseded/deduped copies would overstate a source's coverage) — so agents both discover valid `source_id` values and answer "how much is in the library" without a dashboard round-trip. The per-source lines keep the ownership-OR-location scope rule above while the totals count ownership, so the lines and the total can disagree in either direction, and the tool names each gap WITH its count rather than leaving it to be guessed at: items owned by no registered source are in the total and on no line (the tool lists no sourceless bucket, since there is no `source_id` to scope by), and an item surviving a cross-source dedup collapse adds a membership to a second line. Each caveat is appended only when a given library is actually in that state, rather than spent on every call.
- **`kirocrew knowledge stats [--json]` is the CLI twin of that surface** (§6), and both read `aggregate_stats()` — one aggregate, two renderings, no second copy of the SQL.
- **The response is written through a private stdout descriptor, not fd 1.** The first search's availability probe (`InProcessEmbedder.is_available` → `embed`) kicks the background GGUF load, and the vendored llama-cpp wraps that load in `suppress_stdout_stderr`, which `dup2`s **fd 1 process-wide to `/dev/null`** for the duration (~0.7s) *and* rebinds the `sys.stdout` object. Because the probe returns `None` immediately, the search answers keyword-only in milliseconds — so its JSON-RPC response raced that window and was silently destroyed: no exception, no short write, SEL still logging `success`, and the client hanging until the ACP tool-stall watchdog (`acp/client.py::_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT`, 600s) killed the turn. `mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop` now takes an `os.dup(1)` snapshot (`snapshot_stdout_fd`) at server startup before any tool can run, and `respond()` writes through it under a lock, so responses (and `ping` / `tools/list` replies, which were equally exposed) always reach the client. Falls back to `sys.stdout` when stdout is not fd-backed. Note that "has `sys.stdout` been swapped?" is *not* a usable guard — the suppressor swaps the object too, so it reads as swapped exactly inside the window that must be survived.

The dashboard Knowledge tab uses the same store via a lazily-initialized `KnowledgeStore` on `DashboardState` (`dashboard/state.py`).

## 5. Source-scoped list API (`dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py`)

The dashboard Knowledge list view is **source-first**: it renders one collapsed
row per source and pages *within* a source, rather than paging all items globally
and grouping whatever landed on the page. Two pieces of API surface support this.

### `GET /api/knowledge/items?source_id=<id>`

Scopes the page to a single source. Composes with the existing `type`, `status`,
`namespace`, `q`, `page`, and `limit` params.

- The reported `total` is **scoped to that source**, not the global count. The
  in-group pager derives its page count from it, so a global total would break
  the pager math.
- `source_id=__none__` selects items with no source (`source_id` NULL or empty).
- Applied in both branches of `list_items`: as a SQL predicate in the list
  branch, and via `_matches_source` after ranking in the hybrid-search branch.
- Because the hybrid-search branch filters *after* the retriever has ranked
  globally, a scoped search escalates its candidate pool
  (`_search_until_exhausted`: `_SCOPED_SEARCH_START` doubling to
  `_SCOPED_SEARCH_MAX`) until the retriever short-reads, so the scoped total is
  exact rather than truncated by a fixed window. At the cap the total may
  understate. `HybridRetriever.search` now accepts `source_id` (seed-scoped —
  see §4); adopting it in this branch is the remaining follow-up. Unscoped
  searches keep the cheap `limit * 3` window.

### `GET /api/knowledge/source-counts`

Returns the item count per source **under the active filters**:

```json
{ "counts": { "<source_id>": 42, "__none__": 3 }, "total": 45 }
```

- Accepts `type`, `status`, and `namespace`; the counts reflect them, which is
  why the list view uses this rather than `/sources.item_count` (a source's
  unfiltered, all-namespace total that would over-report when filtered).
- Sourceless items are reported under the `__none__` key.
- The list view derives its rows from these counts, which is what guarantees
  every source is visible at once regardless of relative size.

## 6. Read-only stats (`store.aggregate_stats`, `kirocrew knowledge stats`)

`KnowledgeStore.aggregate_stats()` returns the library's admitted content as a
frozen `ContentStats`: `sources`, `documents`, `items`, and a `per_source` tuple
of `SourceContentStats` carrying the same two counts per source. It is the single
aggregate behind both the CLI verb and the MCP tool, so the two can never
disagree.

The two units it separates are the reason the verb exists at all:

- an **item** is a row in `items` — a CHUNK. This is the unit
  `knowledge_list_sources` and `/source-counts` already call an item, and the
  count the release note names the "admitted item count".
- a **document** is `(source_id, content_hash)`. Every chunk of one document
  carries that document's whole-text hash, which is the identity `dedup` groups
  on. An item written without a content hash counts in `items` and belongs to no
  document.

Two properties make the numbers auditable:

- **`per_source` reconciles exactly** — its `items` sum to `items` and its
  `documents` to `documents`. That is why membership here is plain ownership
  (`items.source_id`), NOT the ownership-OR-location rule §4 uses to estimate a
  scope's yield; under that rule an item surviving a cross-source dedup collapse
  counts for two sources.
- **Every registered source is listed, even at zero**, so a source that ingested
  nothing is visible rather than absent. The sourceless bucket is the opposite:
  it is not a registered row, so it appears only when it holds something, and it
  reports `source_id = None`. It holds every active item no registered source
  owns: rows with a NULL `source_id`, and rows whose `source_id` names a source
  that no longer exists. The second kind is unreachable through the store's own
  writes (`items.source_id REFERENCES sources(id)` under `foreign_keys=ON`), but a
  database written before the constraint was enforced can hold one, and the
  reconciliation is a promise about any database the verb reads, not only one
  this store wrote. The store deliberately does not spell it with the
  dashboard's `__none__` sentinel — that string is a contract between the items
  API and the SPA, and a third copy in the store would have to change with them
  while nothing in SQLite needs it. `sources` counts registered sources, so the
  bucket is never one of them.

`kirocrew knowledge stats` prints the totals line plus a `SOURCE / DOCS / ITEMS`
table; `--json` emits `{sources, documents, items, per_source:[{id, name,
documents, items}]}` with `id: null` for the bucket. A missing DB is reported
(SEL `not_configured`), as JSON under `--json` so a script parses one shape
either way; every call emits an SEL event under tool name `knowledge_stats`.

**Read-only is the boundary, not a default.** There is no flush, rebuild, repair
or reindex verb beside it, and a caller who finds the numbers wrong has a
diagnosis rather than a fix — the existing repair paths (the watcher's sig-gated
self-heal, `dedup`) keep owning that. The verb opens the FILE read-only:
`KnowledgeStore.open_read_only` runs neither the schema DDL nor `_migrate()` --
whose orphan sweep takes the writer lock and deletes itemless source rows on
every ordinary open, as `knowledge dedup --apply` and the dashboard still do -- and opens
every connection with SQLite's `mode=ro`, so a write is refused by the engine
rather than by convention. The trade is that a library behind this schema is
reported (SEL `schema_behind`, `{"error": "schema_behind"}` under `--json`) and
not migrated; any migrating open (the gateway, `knowledge dedup --apply`) repairs it. The
MCP twin, `knowledge_list_sources`, opens the file the same way -- its own
`KnowledgeStore.open_read_only` connection, `mode=ro`, closed after the call --
rather than borrowing the cached store `local_knowledge_search` builds with the
migrating constructor, and it reports a schema-behind library (SEL
`schema_behind`, with the same `knowledge dedup --apply` pointer) instead of
migrating it.

## Invariants

- **`sources.properties` / `entities.aliases` well-formedness is enforced at the writer** — `store.import_bundle()` validates that any present value is UTF-8-encodable JSON text parsing to an object / array of strings (absent/`null` falls back to the schema defaults `'{}'`/`'[]'`), raising `KnowledgeBundleError` before the INSERT. The dashboard import handler is the store's only production caller today; enforcing at the writer makes any future caller (MCP tool, CLI import, app backend) safe by construction. Several readers parse the raw column with `json.loads()` and no shape guard (source detail handlers index the parsed dict; `find_entity()` calls `.lower()` on each parsed alias), so a corrupt committed row would crash a later, unrelated read. The dashboard import handler maps the typed error to a 400 (`code: malformed_knowledge_bundle`).
- **Sensitive paths never ingested** — `FileReader.read`, `FolderWatcher._walk`, `_hash_file`, and `_ingest_file` all gate on `is_sensitive_path()` (with symlink re-resolution at ingest time for TOCTOU).
- **`.org` and unknown-but-supported extensions are plain text** — only `_DISPATCH` extensions get specialized readers; everything else in `SUPPORTED` flows through `_read_text` → generic chunker.
- **Pool workers are long-lived and must be sweep-shielded** — any direct `AcpClient` worker that outlives a chat turn (not tracked in `SessionMap`/warm pool) must register its PID via `register_protected_pid`, or the orphan sweep will kill it mid-task.
- **LLM-derived text is redacted before storage and before return** — ingestion redacts extracted text (`ingestion._redact`), and `local_knowledge_search` redacts its assembled output.
- **FTS query input is parameterized** — user query tokens are always double-quoted literals; the user never injects FTS5 operators.
- **Embedding-dimension mismatches are skipped, not scored** — vector search excludes incomparable-dimension items so a model swap cannot fill the top-K with all-zero ghosts.
- **Taking `store.db` on the event loop is a diagnosable event, not a silent one** — the accessor is guarded (`on_loop_db.OnLoopDBGuard`): strict raises `OnLoopStoreError`, production logs a throttled WARNING with a stack and proceeds. This is what covers callers the lexical `check_sync_io_in_async` gate cannot see, so the two must both stay — neither alone closes #3057.
- **The self-heal rebuild path never touches SQLite on the event loop** — `_maybe_reembed_stale`'s stale COUNT, `rebuild_embeddings`' total COUNT / page SELECTs / batch progress commits, and the success-path job finalize all run via `asyncio.to_thread` (`store.db` is a per-thread connection, so each worker thread uses its own connection to the same WAL db). On a large KB (observed: ~1.3GB after an embedder-sig change) an inline COUNT can stall past the 25s loop-watchdog threshold and crash-loop the gateway. The one deliberate exception is the CancelledError finalize in `_run_reembed_job`, which stays inline so cancellation cannot pre-empt the single-flight finalize. When the stale count exceeds `_LARGE_REBUILD_WARN_THRESHOLD` the watcher logs a prominent WARNING before starting the full re-embed.
- **`__none__` is a shared wire contract** — the no-source sentinel is defined as `_NO_SOURCE` in `dashboard/handlers/knowledge.py` and mirrored as `NO_SOURCE` in `website/src/pages/knowledge/SourceGroup.tsx`. Both sides must change together; it is effectively un-renameable once shipped.
- **A source-scoped `total` is scoped, never global** — `/items?source_id=` reports the count for that source alone, because the per-source pager computes its page count from it.
- **`aggregate_stats` reconciles, and stays read-only** — `per_source` sums to the totals in both columns, which is what makes the numbers auditable and why it counts ownership rather than scope membership. Both the CLI verb and `knowledge_list_sources` render THAT call, so a second copy of the SQL cannot drift; the CLI verb and the MCP tool each open the file `mode=ro` (`KnowledgeStore.open_read_only`), so neither can run the constructor's orphan sweep; and no repair verb ships beside it, so a wrong count is a diagnosis and never a self-mutation.
- **Per-source badge counts are filter-aware** — list-view badges come from `/source-counts` (which honours `type`/`status`/`namespace`), not from `/sources.item_count`, so a badge never disagrees with the group's contents under a filter.
- **The search branch's candidate load runs off the event loop** — a scoped search escalates its candidate pool, so `_load_items_by_id` (batch `SELECT` plus per-row serialization) and the `source_counts` aggregate both run via `asyncio.to_thread`. `store.db` is a per-thread connection, so each worker thread uses its own. Run inline, either can stall the loop past the watchdog threshold on a large KB.
- **Frontend selection is bounded to on-screen items** — in source-first mode item data lives in per-`SourceGroup` caches, so bulk actions read the items each expanded group reports as rendered, and selected IDs are pruned when a group collapses or pages away. Reading the react-query cache directly would let a bulk Delete reach a retained cache for a source the user can no longer see.
- **Per-source caches are keyed under the `knowledge-items` prefix** — `['knowledge-items', 'source-items', ...]` and `['knowledge-items', 'source-counts', ...]` so every existing `invalidateQueries(['knowledge-items'])` call site reaches them. Consequently any `setQueriesData` on that prefix must guard on the payload shape, since the counts entry has no `items` array.

## Graph internals

How the entity graph behind knowledge search is built and stored. The
user-facing behaviour — what gets ingested, what search returns, and the
citation format — is
[`src/kiro_crew/docs/knowledge-library-how-it-works.md`](../../../src/kiro_crew/docs/knowledge-library-how-it-works.md).

### Graph Construction

#### Entities → Nodes

Each extracted entity becomes a node in the graph:
- Deduplication: exact name matching + case-insensitive alias lookup
- If "DynamoDB" appears in chunk 1 and chunk 5, both map to the same node
- Stored in SQLite `entities` table + in-memory `SimpleDiGraph`

#### Relations → Edges

Each extracted relation becomes a directed edge:
- Only created between entities extracted from the **same chunk**
- Edge types: `owns | uses | works_on | part_of | calls | depends_on`
- Stored in SQLite `entity_relations` table + in-memory graph

#### Cross-Chunk Connections

There is NO cross-chunk relation extraction (too expensive). Connections across chunks happen through **shared entity names**:

```
Chunk 1: AuthService ──uses──► DynamoDB
Chunk 5: BackupService ──depends_on──► DynamoDB

Graph result:
  AuthService ──uses──► DynamoDB ◄──depends_on── BackupService
```

The shared "DynamoDB" node creates an implicit connection between AuthService and BackupService — they're 2 hops apart in the graph.

#### Mentions

Every entity-in-chunk creates a `mention` record linking the item (chunk) to the entity. This enables: "show me all chunks that mention DynamoDB."

### Storage and search implementation

- Embeddings are generated **after** extraction, in the same ingestion pipeline
- Stored as packed float32 binary in the `items.embedding` BLOB column
- Vector search uses brute-force cosine similarity
- Existing items with a stale embedding signature are transparently re-embedded by the signature-gated rebuild

Known gaps in the construction above, stated as current behaviour rather than as
a plan: entities connect only through shared names, so `auth layer` and
`AuthService` produce two nodes; `merge_entities` exists but no ingestion path
calls it; and nothing computes entity communities, so a cluster of related
entities has no representation a query can select on.

Writers: `knowledge/store.py` (the `entities`, `entity_relations` and `mentions`
tables, `items.embedding`, the signature-gated re-embed), `knowledge/extractor.py`
(per-chunk entity and relation extraction), `knowledge/ingestion.py` (chunking,
dedup, the embedding pass), `knowledge/retrieval.py` (`SimpleDiGraph`, the three
search legs and their RRF fusion).
