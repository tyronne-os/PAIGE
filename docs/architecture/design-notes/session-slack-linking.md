# Session and Slack Thread Linking

How a Slack thread maps onto a Kiro Crew session, and how messages mirror in both
directions across the two surfaces.

The invariant the whole design serves: **one conversation, one kiro-cli session,
two surfaces.** A linked thread and its dashboard tab drive the same session key,
so neither surface spawns a second ACP process, and neither has a private
transcript.

## Where the link lives

The link is persisted on the session map entry (`session_map.py`,
`~/.kiro/crew/session_map.json`), not in a gateway-lifetime dict, so it survives a
restart. Two fields on the entry:

```
slack_thread_ts    Slack thread parent timestamp
slack_channel_id   the channel the thread lives in
```

`SessionMap` keeps a `_thread_to_session` reverse index (thread_ts -> session key)
rebuilt from `_data` on load and maintained by `set_slack_link` /
`clear_slack_link` / `_remove_entry`. `SessionManager` forwards
`set_slack_link` / `get_slack_link` / `clear_slack_link` /
`get_session_for_thread` through to it.

Entries are also read as a legacy plain string (`{"key": "sid"}`) and migrated to
the dict shape on load, and bare Slack `thread_ts` keys are namespaced to
`slack:<thread>` via `messaging.link.canonical_key`. The raw `thread_ts` stays
inside the entry so the reverse index and the resume path are unaffected by that
rename.

`set_channel` / `set_thread` / `get_channel` / `get_thread` on `SessionManager`
remain as thin compatibility shims over `set_slack_link` / `get_slack_link`; new
code uses the link API directly.

### Channel-neutral generalization

`set_mirror_link` / `get_mirror_link` / `clear_mirror_link` expose the same
binding as a channel-neutral `ChannelLink` so the dashboard turn path can deliver
a reply to any proactive-capable channel through `Transport.send_message` without
special-casing Slack. Slack is the one channel that routes back through the
dedicated fields and the `_thread_to_session` index; every other channel stores a
`ChannelLink` under `mirror`. A legacy Slack-only entry synthesizes the equivalent
Slack `ChannelLink` on read, so callers never branch.

`mirror_accepts_inbound` distinguishes a two-way session-resume binding from an
outbound-only mirror. Slack never sets it, because Slack has its own inbound leg.

## In-memory projection on the dashboard side

`_ChatSlot` mirrors the persisted link into `_slack_linked`, `_slack_channel`,
`_slack_thread_ts` (`dashboard/state.py`), serialized to the frontend as
`slack_linked` / `slack_channel` / `slack_thread_ts`. `DashboardState` keeps
`_slack_to_slot` (thread_ts -> slot name) for the inbound Slack lookup.

Both are caches over the session map, not the source of truth:

- `get_or_create_slot` hydrates the three slot fields from
  `sessions.get_slack_link(effective_session_key(slot))`, so a restored tab
  re-adopts its link with no separate restore pass.
- Hydration goes through `_is_genuine_slack_link`, which requires BOTH a
  thread_ts and a channel id and rejects a channel id namespaced to a non-Slack
  transport. Other transports still write their namespaced origin id through the
  legacy channel field, and those are projected separately under `links`. Without
  this check a Telegram-origin session would light up the destructive Slack
  actions in the UI.
- `get_linked_slot` self-heals: if the mapped slot is gone, is no longer
  `_slack_linked`, or now points at a different thread, the stale
  `_slack_to_slot` row is dropped and the lookup misses.
- `link_slack` is the only writer of a `_slack_to_slot` row. It evicts the old
  thread row when a slot re-links, and when the target thread was owned by a
  *different* slot it clears that slot's fields and its persisted link too, so a
  thread can never read as owned by two slots.

Note the asymmetry in what survives a restart. The persisted link (and therefore
the outbound dashboard-to-Slack mirror, which reads `get_slack_link` per turn)
comes back automatically. `_slack_to_slot` does not: nothing repopulates it at
boot, so the inbound `get_linked_slot` fast path only exists for links formed in
the current process. Inbound Slack messages still reach the right session after a
restart via `sessions.get_session_for_thread(reply_ts)` in `handle_message`, which
reads the persisted reverse index.

`effective_session_key(slot)` is the authoritative key throughout: a
channel-born slot carries the real channel key in `linked_session_key` and its
turns run on the channel session, so the link has to live there. Deriving the key
from the slot NAME instead would write `dashboard:slack:<ts>` and leave the real
link untouched, so mirroring would silently resume on the next turn.

## Establishing a link

| Origin | How the link is set |
|---|---|
| Slack DM or @mention thread | Self-link. `handle_message` calls `set_slack_link(session_key, reply_ts, channel)` on a new session. `reply_ts` (`thread_ts or msg_ts`), never the namespaced key, is stored as `slack_thread_ts`: storing the namespaced form would corrupt reply routing. |
| Dashboard, user action | `POST /api/chat/slots/{name}/slack-link`. Opens a DM (or uses a supplied channel), posts a thread anchor, links, and back-fills the last 5 messages as context. |
| Dashboard, auto-link from a redirect | The same endpoint with `thread_ts` in the body. Links to THAT existing thread instead of posting a new one, which is what makes a thread reply route back bidirectionally. Context back-fill is skipped, since the thread already contains those messages. |
| Slack thread imported to dashboard | `!link-to-dashboard` (`/kirocrew link-to-dashboard`) fetches the thread, redacts each message, imports up to the last 50 into a fresh slot, then `link_slack`. Idempotent: an already-linked thread returns its existing slot. |
| `/kirocrew sessions` resume | Posts a resume header in-thread or in a DM, then `set_slack_link` plus `dashboard_state.link_slack`. |

The anchor message title never exposes a raw slot key. The chain is LLM title,
then a one-line snippet of the first user prompt, then a neutral default;
redaction (`redact_and_truncate`) runs on the full text BEFORE truncation so a
truncation boundary cannot split and thereby hide a credential.

## Message routing

### Slack to dashboard

`maybe_route_linked_thread` (`slack/handler.py`) runs before hook handling and
before any turn work, on both the native and messaging-transport paths:

1. Look up `get_linked_slot(reply_ts)`. The index is keyed by the **bare
   thread_ts**, not the namespaced session key, so canonical `slack:<ts>` keys
   still hit.
2. Authorize FIRST. An unauthorized user is denied and SEL-logged before
   anything is appended to the slot.
3. `!`-bang commands deliberately fall through to normal Slack handling.
4. Append the user message to the slot (redacted for display only, the LLM
   receives the original text), broadcast it over the WebSocket, and either
   start `_run_chat` or `queue_append` if the slot is already running.

`handle_message` also consults `sessions.get_session_for_thread(reply_ts)`
independently: when a thread resolves to a different session key, the turn is
re-pointed at that key so the reply runs on the linked session. Channel
activation checks (`observe`, `mention`, `review` with `thread_follow`) treat a
thread with a mapped session as an active thread, so a follow-up reply does not
need a fresh @mention.

### Dashboard to Slack

In `chat_runner._run_chat`, gated on `not is_slash and not _is_synthetic`:

1. Read `get_slack_link(session_key)`. A dashboard session may hold its link on
   the bare key while the turn runs under the `dashboard:`-prefixed one, so the
   runner copies the link forward at turn start. Both spellings must be cleared
   on unlink or the next turn re-inherits the link.
2. Echo the user message to the thread, then `start_stream` for live tool
   animations.
3. Tool calls mirror as stream tasks (`append_task` in_progress, then complete),
   with titles redacted and capped.
4. The completed reply is converted to Slack mrkdwn, redacted, split on the
   channel message limit, and posted; extracted OPTIONS render as Block Kit
   buttons.
5. `stop_stream` runs in the turn's `finally` so a cancelled or failed turn does
   not leave a live stream.

The channel-neutral leg (`_deliver_cross_surface_user_message` /
`_deliver_cross_surface_reply`) handles a linked NON-Slack channel and is skipped
for Slack, which keeps its dedicated rich streaming mirror. It is
capability-gated on `supports_proactive_send` and governance-gated fail-closed.

### Tool approvals

A tool-approval prompt on a linked session is mirrored into the thread with
Approve / Reject buttons — Approve / Trust / Reject in a DM whose card is
grantable, see below — (`post_linked_approval`), because a Slack-only user
would otherwise never see it and the turn would park for the whole
`agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` window (600s by default) holding
the slot lock. The click resolves the dashboard slot's approval future, so there
is still exactly one caller of `approve_tool` / `reject_tool`.

Delivery failure is not allowed to become a silent park: if the post fails (or
anything raises before the future is resolved, including `CancelledError` on the
cancel path) the future is resolved as `rejected` and the user is told, so they
retry rather than wait. A cancelled turn never obtained consent, so `rejected` is
the correct reading.

Trust is offered on this path only when the mirror target is a DM (`channel`
starts with `D` — Trust escalates the whole session, so a group channel gets
Approve / Reject, the same blast-radius rule as the native path) **and** the
dashboard's pending card carries the server's durable-grant proof
(`trust_grantable`, which `chat_runner` stamps only on unredacted, fully
derivable calls precisely so an alternate approval surface cannot offer a durable
grant off a pending card). `post_linked_approval` re-derives that proof from the
owning slot's card rather than trusting its caller, records the verdict on the
`_LinkedApproval` entry, and the click acts on that recorded verdict rather than
on the `action_id` the Slack payload carries.

A Trust click writes all three halves the grant needs — `slot._trust`, which
`chat_runner._slot_is_trusted` re-reads per event, plus the two the shared
`messaging.session_trust.add_trusted_session` owns: `approval_policy="auto"`, which a
spawned subagent inherits, and the in-memory grant mapping that the channel
`TurnDriver`'s `auto_approve_session` predicate reads — all keyed by the slot's
effective session key. Policy alone would be erased by the next
`_persistable_session_policy` write; `_trust` alone would never reach subagents; and
without the shared mapping a Slack-typed follow-up on a CHANNEL-BORN session's own
thread would re-prompt for every tool, because that thread is deliberately absent
from `_slack_to_slot` and so is driven by `slack/transport_dispatch` rather than by
the dashboard chat runner. The grant is taken in `strict` mode, so a failing policy
write undoes the mapping half and raises rather than reporting a partial grant as
"Trusted".
It fails closed: no proof, no `SessionManager`, no live owning slot, or any raise
grants nothing, resolves the request as Reject, and returns the Rejected label,
never a mislabelled "Trusted". Every outcome emits a `slack.interactive.trust_linked`
SEL event.

## Unlinking

`POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/slack-unlink` is the symmetric counterpart. It
clears the link (both the effective key and, for a dashboard session, its bare
twin), resets the three slot fields, and posts a best-effort courtesy note into
the thread so a Slack watcher knows why it went quiet. The session, its history,
and the thread itself all survive. Idempotent: unlinking an unlinked session
returns `was_linked: false`.

`clear_slack_link` evicts the `_thread_to_session` row as well as the fields.
Without that eviction a later reply in the old thread would re-route to the
session and silently re-engage mirroring.

Auth posture matches the link endpoint and adds no new surface: both are
mixed-internal via the `/api/chat` prefix, so on loopback they accept the
internal secret and otherwise fall back to dashboard-token plus CSRF. Neither
belongs in the strict `internal_paths` set, which would wrongly restrict a
browser action to loopback-only callers.

## Concurrency and ordering

- **Two surfaces, one semaphore.** Dashboard and Slack both acquire the same
  per-session `Semaphore(1)`, which is the mechanism that keeps them on one
  conversation. A slow turn on one surface blocks the other; that is the same
  serialization concurrent Slack messages in a thread already rely on.
- **No duplicate processes.** The race check inside `get_or_create` resolves a
  simultaneous acquire for one key: the loser shuts down its provider and uses
  the winner's.
- **No cross-surface ordering guarantee.** Slack events arrive asynchronously
  while slot appends are synchronous, so interleaving between the two surfaces is
  not ordered. Within one session the semaphore still serializes turns.
- **Mirror posts are best-effort and never buffered.** Every mirror call site
  wraps its post in a `try`/`except` that logs at debug and continues, so a
  Slack-side failure (rate limit, transient 5xx) costs one mirrored message and
  not the turn. Only `open_dm` retries (`slack/retry.py`); `post_message` stays
  single-shot at each call site so a retry cannot duplicate a message.
