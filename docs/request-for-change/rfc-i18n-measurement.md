# RFC: i18n — closing the measurement gap

- Status: partial — 1 of 6 proposals shipped, 1 partial, 3 unstarted, 1 deliberately deferred. **Shipped:** #3, the pseudolocale overflow gate (`website/scripts/check-i18n-render.mjs` + `lib/render-scan.mjs`, real `scrollWidth − clientWidth` measurement against the IBM expansion curve, wired into CI at `ci.yml:775`, PR #1107). **Partial:** #4, the `localeCompare` migration — the ceiling went 97 → 62 → **37** and `compareText` now has real consumers, but `SessionGridView.tsx:214` still sorts a timestamp through `localeCompare`. **Unstarted:** #1 source-hash staleness, #2 GEMBA-MQM/MQM 2.0 scoring, #6 `saveMissing` + word-count coverage. **Deferred by decision, not neglect:** #5 lazy-loading, recorded as out-of-scope in issue #1004 pending a 25%-of-JS-gzip or >20-language trigger.
- **Attribution caveat:** the two proposals that moved were already in flight under the pre-existing remediation program (issue #1004, which predates this RFC and already owned the pseudolocale assertions and locale-aware formatting). PR #1009 merged **18 hours before this document did**. The three genuinely novel *measurement* proposals — the ones the title is about — have zero code. Read "partial" accordingly.

## Summary

KiroCrew's i18n mechanism is **structurally rigorous and linguistically
unmeasured**. The structural half is, in places, better than industry practice:
CLDR plural categories are exactly correct in all ten locales, key parity is
exact, and the ratchet design is more disciplined than the norm. The unmeasured
half is the risk: **46,161 target-catalog values** across the nine non-English
locales — initially machine-generated, with human corrections layered in since —
ship with no quality metric, no review-status ladder, and no stale-source
invalidation. Nothing in CI can distinguish a good translation
from a fluent, confident, wrong one.

Separately, localization **stops at the dashboard React tree**. The window frame
around it, the notifications it sends, the CLI that installed it, and the site it
was downloaded from are all English-only.

This RFC does not propose a rewrite. It proposes six changes, ordered by
value-per-diff, and is explicit about which of its findings are already fixed.

## Scope and method

Seven parallel audit lanes ran against a clean checkout at `f6ec5834`. Findings
were then re-measured against `5ec356d5` before this document was written,
because two i18n commits landed in between (see *Already fixed*). Numbers below
are current unless marked *(at `f6ec5834`)*.

Stack: `i18next@26.3.6` + `react-i18next@17.0.11` (`website/package.json:61,68`).
No ICU. Ten authored locales — `en, zh-CN, hi, es, fr, bn, pt, ru, de, it` — plus
the `en-XA` pseudolocale (`website/src/i18n/languages.ts:50-75`).

## Already fixed — findings this RFC withdraws

The audit found that `qa-allowlist.json` could absorb any future violation via a
single environment variable, making the gate self-defeating. **That is fixed.**
Commit `5ec356d5` (#1060) deleted the 962-line allowlist outright, moved the
strict gates to diff scope, and introduced the design rule now recorded in
`website/AGENTS.md`:

> A ratchet may only be upward-only if a DIFF-SCOPED gate covers the same defect.

The audit's own finding was narrower: the ratchet could be re-snapshotted past
with a single `--update`. `website/AGENTS.md`, added by the same commit, records
the team's measurement of what that cost in practice — commit `195904c` shipped
a new app carrying 113 untranslated strings while moving `_total` from 1747 to
1860, green, under the fully bidirectional gate. That commit fails
`[added-lines]` today.

This is a better fix than the audit would have proposed, and it supersedes the
finding. `#1046` additionally added a referenced-key-existence gate
(`website/src/i18n/keyReference.test.ts`, 549 lines).

## What already works, with numbers

**CLDR plural completeness is exact.** 45 plural families expand to precisely
the categories each locale requires, plus 5,014 non-plural keys:

| Locale | CLDR cardinal categories | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zh-CN` | other | 5014 + 45×1 = 5059 | **5059** |
| `en` `de` `hi` `bn` | one, other | 5014 + 45×2 = 5104 | **5104** |
| `es` `fr` `it` `pt` | one, many, other | 5014 + 45×3 = 5149 | **5149** |
| `ru` | one, few, many, other | 5014 + 45×4 = 5194 | **5194** |

`catalogParity.test.ts` checks each language against its *own* categories, and
`scripts/i18n-translate.mjs` rejects an impossible plural form as well as adding
categories English lacks. The failure mode this avoids — shipping `_one`/`_other`
everywhere and being silently wrong for Russian 2–4 — is what i18next's
suffix-key dialect makes easy to reach.

**Non-plural key parity is exact** — 5,014 in every locale. Mozilla's Firefox
Beta gate is "100% of the high-priority surface"; this is 100% everywhere.

**Runtime-computed keys are effectively absent** — **exactly one dynamic site**
(`website/src/surfaces/registry.ts:324`, `i18nT(s.labelKey)`) and zero
template-literal keys, against roughly 5,700 `i18nT()` calls. Treat
`node website/scripts/check-i18n-keys.mjs --report` as the authority on the total
rather than any figure quoted here: independent AST scans of this tree disagree in
the low single digits depending on whether test files and multi-call lines are
counted. The load-bearing fact is the numerator — static extraction covers every
call but that one. Two separate gates apply:
`dynamicKeys.test.ts` carries no number and is zero-tolerance, while
`dynamic-keys-baseline.json` (generated by `check-i18n-keys.mjs --update`) is a
ledger of the sites the gate *cannot* check, to be ratcheted down — currently the
one registry site.

**The pseudolocale implements a monotonic adaptation of the IBM/W3C
expansion-by-length curve**, not the flat 40% heuristic:
`website/scripts/gen-pseudolocale.mjs:78-84` gives ≤10-char strings
2.5× and >70-char strings 1.3×. That is the correct shape — short labels in
fixed-width chrome are where expansion actually breaks. It also brackets every
value so a codemod-split sentence renders as two visible fragments, and preserves
`{{…}}` / `<…>` / `$t(…)` / URLs in a single pass. Tag choice is correct (`en-XA`
is the ICU/Android convention), it is `devOnly`, and `pseudolocaleBundle.test.ts`
proves its exclusion from the production runtime registry. (It re-evaluates
`CATALOGS` with `DEV=false`; it does not inspect built bundle bytes, so a
bundle-artifact assertion is still missing. The 51–70-char row deviates
deliberately from the published table — see the appendix.)

**Per-locale style guides exist for all nine non-English locales and are
machine-enforced** (`website/src/i18n/style/*.md` + `*Style.test.ts`). I am aware
of no comparable public example, though I have not surveyed systematically.
`zhStyle.test.ts` is the strongest — 21 zero-tolerance
assertions and a 12-pair terminology denylist gated on the *English* source
rather than blind substring matching.

**Gates run on push-to-main and PRs with no path filters**
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml:3-6`).

## The measurement gap

Industry practice (Weblate, Crowdin, Lokalise, Transifex) converges on a small
set of numbers. Against that set:

| Metric | Benchmark | Here |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage, **word-count** | reported by Weblate, Crowdin and Transifex; manipulation-resistant and tracks effort | ❌ not computed |
| Coverage, string-count | secondary (risk metric) | ✅ 100%, exact |
| **Review-status ladder** | 2–4 states (Weblate `translated`⊂`approved`; Lokalise ×4) | ❌ one state: exists and differs from English |
| **MQM / LQA scoring** | error typology, critical/major/minor weighting, sampled | ❌ none |
| **MT quality** (COMET / GEMBA-MQM) | the WMT metrics task's own instruments for judging machine output | ❌ none |
| Native-speaker sign-off | release gate | ❌ social only — the PR. No CODEOWNERS entry for locales |
| **Stale-source invalidation** | source hash → fuzzy / needs-review flag | ❌ **absent** |
| Externalisation rate | 100% + reviewed allowlist | ⚠️ 1,860 literals across 269 files |
| Pseudoloc **render** gate | visual diff at pseudolocale | ❌ generated, never asserted |
| Production missing-key telemetry | `saveMissing` + handler | ❌ absent from `website/src/i18n/index.ts` |
| Placeholder / DNT integrity | TMS QA check | ✅ enforced |
| Plural-category completeness | CLDR-derived | ✅ exact |

The only quality-adjacent number in the repo is `PASSTHROUGH_LIMIT = 0.5`
(`website/scripts/i18n-translate.mjs`), which detects byte-identity to English
and nothing else. `website/src/i18n/TRANSLATION-PROMPT.md:144` is candid about it: *"What `verify`
cannot check is whether the translation is good."*

**Stale-source invalidation is the most consequential absence.** It is not a
coverage problem, it is correctness decay, and it compounds silently. `mergeCatalog`
is insert-only, so when an English string changes the translation simply stays.
gettext marks a changed source `fuzzy`; Lokalise flips targets to *unverified* on
a base-language edit. Neither exists here — in the catalogs or in the context
sidecar, where `contextSidecar.test.ts` catches a key *rename* but not a key whose
*value* changed under a now-wrong description.

## Correctness gaps

### Critical

**97 of 109 locale-API call sites pass no locale** *as measured when this RFC was
written*, so dates, times, numbers and sort order follow the *browser*, not
`dashboard.language`. AST-verified. Split at that time: 39 `localeCompare` ·
37 `toLocaleString` · 12 `toLocaleDateString` · 9 `toLocaleTimeString`. The live
figure is the `BASELINE` ceiling in `website/src/i18n/localeFormatting.test.ts`,
now **62** after the Phase 4 date/time batch migrated the 35 `toLocale*` date and
time sites; what remains is 39 `localeCompare` plus 23 number/date sites. `compareText`/`collator` (`website/src/i18n/format.ts:399-418`)
are built, tested, and have **zero consumers**.

This is load-bearing for any future RTL locale, not cosmetic: an `Intl` call
without a locale inherits the browser's, which selects the wrong *numbering
system* (Arabic-Indic vs Latin digits) independently of `dir`.

**All ten authored catalogs are eagerly bundled** — 12 static imports, zero
dynamic, in `website/src/i18n/index.ts:33-44`, and
`website/vite.config.ts:426-427` returns early for
non-`node_modules` ids so no locale is ever split out. *(At `f6ec5834`: 940 KB
gzip on the critical path, of which 877 KB — 91% — is unreadable by any single
user.)* The file's own header sets the threshold at "roughly 6+ languages";
ten ship.

### High

**Zero `<Trans>` usage.** *(At `f6ec5834`: 148 sites place `i18nT()` adjacent to
inline `<a>`/`<strong>`/`<code>`, and 416 of 3,955 `en.json` keys — 10.5%,
excluding `en.manual.json` — are sentence
fragments, including 40 whose entire value is one connective word: `of` ×7,
`by` ×3, `at`, `or`, `then`, `via`.)* This is the defect class ICU exists to
eliminate.

**40 hand-rolled English plural sites** build `${n} thing${n===1?'':'s'}` in
template literals that no catalog value can reach. `i18n-plural-codemod.mjs
--check` is wired into `i18n:check` and guards *already-converted* keys against
regression; it does not reach strings that were never catalog keys. Some of the
40 construct LLM prompt text and fall outside the rule's scope, which governs
user-facing strings (`website/src/components/CommentOverlay.tsx:224`),
but user-visible ones are not — `website/src/App.tsx:499`, `website/src/App.tsx:619`,
`website/src/components/InlineCommentOverlay.tsx:171`,
`website/src/components/ArtifactFolderDeleteDialog.tsx:41`.

**Message format is i18next's native dialect, not ICU.** Among the React i18n
stacks surveyed below it is the non-ICU option, and it is the expensive decision
to reverse. i18next does support context-suffixed keys (`context?: unknown`,
"Used for contexts (eg. male/female)"), but the repository uses none, and the
native dialect has no ICU-style inline `select` — so the gender agreement
`ru`/`hi`/`bn` need when a person or agent name lands in a sentence with a verb
is expressible only by hand-enumerating context keys.

**No Cyrillic script-fallback alias.** `ru` is the only shipped non-Latin locale
with no entry in `--script-fallbacks` (`website/src/index.css:118`), and
`website/src/i18n/scriptFonts.test.ts:51-56` is structurally incapable of noticing, because it
validates only the four aliases that exist.

**One global `line-height: 1.55` and zero `:lang()` rules** in the entire
stylesheet (`website/src/index.css:1061`). Devanagari and Bengali get
Latin-calibrated leading, which is tighter than either script's matra/reph stack
wants. No clipping measurement has been taken, so the size of the effect is
unquantified.

**Zero bidi isolates.** No `<bdi>`, no `dir="auto"`, and
`document.documentElement.dir` is never assigned anywhere. No RTL *UI* locale
ships, so the chrome is safe — but user content (session names, PR titles, file
paths) containing Arabic or Hebrew **can reorder adjacent punctuation and
neighbouring content**, in any locale. No bidi fixture or rendered reproduction
exists, so the blast radius is unmeasured.

**Backend, Electron, CLI and site are English-only.** No `gettext`, `babel`, or
`Accept-Language` anywhere in `src/kiro_crew`; `dashboard.language` is stored,
served, and injected into the LLM prompt only. Native menus
(`website/electron/app-menu.js`), tray (`createTray` in
`website/electron/window-lifecycle.js`), and dialogs (`resolveGatewayConflict`
in `website/electron/gateway-supervisor.js` and
`offerRelocationIfUnupdatable` in `website/electron/main.js`) are hardcoded, as
are update notifications (the `notifyUpdateFound` callback in `registerUpdater`
in `website/electron/ipc-registrar.js`).
`src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills` has 79 user-facing
`print`/`echo` lines and zero i18n references. `site/` has no `i18n` directory.

### Medium

- A stored or server-provided tag that is not an exact `SUPPORTED_CODES` member is
  **discarded** rather than negotiated (`website/src/i18n/detect.ts:133`), while the
  backend accepts any tag matching its own **conservative BCP-47 subset**
  (`src/kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/core.py:299-307,377`). `dashboard.language='de-AT'`
  silently becomes browser-detected.
- Script subtags are ignored: `zh-Hant` resolves to `zh-CN` (Simplified).
- `pt` is Brazilian content — 96 `arquivo` and 72 `você` occurrences across 71
  distinct values — that `pt-PT` resolves to
  *confidently*.
- Context sidecar covers **102 of 5,104 keys (2.00%)**. Deliberate — opaque keys
  only — but the ≤3-visible-character threshold excludes `"Plan"`, `"Run"`,
  `"Stop"`, which are exactly the verb/noun ambiguities it exists for.
- Glossary is **19 DNT terms, 3 of them dead** (`Node.js`, `TypeScript`, `npm`
  have zero source hits), inspecting ~4.6% of the corpus. It
  is a do-not-translate absence gate, not a TMS glossary: there is no source→target
  mapping, so `workspace`/`session`/`crew`/`artifact`/`skill` have no consistency
  enforcement.
- `bn` and `pt` style tests skip register entirely (তুমি/আপনি, você/tu/o senhor)
  while the structurally identical `hi` rule *is* tested.
- `es`/`fr`/`pt`/`it` have zero coverage in any formatting test.

## Coverage by surface

| Surface | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard React UI | **Partially localized** — 10 catalogs at exact parity, but 1,860 hardcoded literals remain | catalogs, `catalogParity.test.ts`, `untranslated-baseline.json` |
| Dashboard formatting | **Partial** — 62 sites still follow the browser, down from 97/109 | `localeFormatting.test.ts` (`BASELINE`) |
| Electron chrome | **English-only** | `app-menu.js`, `window-lifecycle.js`, `gateway-supervisor.js`, `ipc-registrar.js`, `main.js` |
| Backend (notifications, channels, API errors) | **English-only** | no `gettext`/`babel`/`Accept-Language` |
| CLI | **English-only** | same |
| Built-in skills | **English-only** | 79 `print`/`echo` lines |
| Marketing site | **English-only** | no `site/src/i18n` |
| Skill docs (`SKILL.md`) | English **by design** | agent-facing, not user copy |

## Proposed changes

**1. Source-hash staleness detection.** Fingerprint each English value; on change,
flag the corresponding target `needs-review`. Apply the same to `en.context.json`,
where a changed value silently keeps a now-wrong description. Highest
value-per-diff and no external dependency. Prior art: gettext `fuzzy`, Lokalise
auto-unverify on base edit.

**2. A real quality metric.** GEMBA-MQM V2 is state of the art as of WMT25 (first
by average correlation on the WMT24 MQM test sets). Implement as a **screen, not a
verdict**: ~10 aggregated judgments per sampled segment, routing to a human review
sample. Score with MQM 2.0 — seven dimensions, exponential severity multipliers
`0/1/5/25`, `NPT = (APT × RWC) / EWC` normalized per 1,000 words, calibrated
passing threshold. ISO 5060 permits character counts instead of words, which
matters for `zh-CN`. Note WMT25's own official ranking is human evaluation and
*supersedes* the automatic ranking — hence screen, not verdict.

Scope note: MQM 2.0 deleted its Internationalization dimension, so this covers
translation quality only. The externalisation, concatenation and bidi gaps below
are i18n-readiness and need the lint/pseudoloc gates instead — two regimes, not
one.

**3. Consume the pseudolocale.** The 1.3×–2.5× expansion budget already exists and
nothing asserts against it. A pass at `en-XA` checking `scrollWidth > clientWidth`
across the truncation/nowrap/clamp sites turns a manual eyeball tool into a gate.
Consider `ar-XB` (Android's mirrored pseudolocale; Windows `qps-plocm`) if RTL is
ever on the roadmap.

**4. Migrate the 35 text-comparison `localeCompare` sites to `compareText`, and
replace the other 4 with byte comparisons.** Those four compare ISO timestamps,
where collation is the wrong tool entirely —
`website/src/components/SessionGridView.tsx:214`,
`website/src/pages/ArtifactDetailPage.tsx:49`, and both branches at
`website/src/pages/ChatSidebar.tsx:560`. Pure adoption otherwise: the seam is
built and tested with zero consumers. Note `localeFormatting.test.ts` is
exact-in-both-directions, so the same change **must** lower `BASELINE`
(line 73) — a migration PR that leaves it at 97 fails CI.

**5. Lazy-load catalogs** via `i18next-http-backend` + a `<Suspense>` boundary,
exactly as `website/src/i18n/index.ts:19-27` already prescribes.

**6. Add `saveMissing` + word-count coverage reporting.** Cheap instrumentation for
the two numbers we are blind to. Caveat: i18next does not fire `missingKeyHandler`
for keys resolved via `fallbackLng`, so this catches broken references rather than
translation gaps — pair it with a `resolvedLanguage` check.

## Non-goals

- **Do not adopt MessageFormat 2.** It is spec-stable (Final Candidate since March
  2025, refined in LDML 47/48) but ecosystem-dead: TC39's `Intl.MessageFormat` is
  at Stage 2.7, awaiting implementations; `i18next-mf2`
  draws ~6 weekly downloads; FormatJS, Lingui and Tolgee are all still MF1; no TMS
  ships MF2 support. The actionable move for gap 3 above is **`i18next-icu` (MF1)**,
  whose install base tripled over the past year (~100k → ~300k weekly).
- **Do not ship an RTL locale before the layout migration.** `website/AGENTS.md`
  already states this correctly. Worth recording that it is cheaper than it looks:
  Tailwind ships the full logical-utility set (`ms-*`/`me-*`, `ps-*`/`pe-*`,
  `start-*`/`end-*`, `text-start`/`text-end`) and `rtl:`/`ltr:` variants whose
  variants. Both resolve against a `[dir]` attribute on this repo's Tailwind —
  declared `^3.4.19` at `website/package.json:108` and locked to 3.4.19 — whereas
  matching the CSS `:dir()` pseudo-class arrives in v4, so a migration should
  confirm the emitted selector against the installed version rather than trusting
  either this RFC or current Tailwind docs. (`@tailwindcss/browser@4.1.13` in the
  tree is only the widget-iframe runtime, not the dashboard build.) Logical
  properties are at 96.71% global support and logical `border-*-radius` longhands
  have been Baseline-widely-available since Sept 2021. So the work is utility
  renames plus `dir` plumbing — no `rtlcss`/`postcss-rtlcss` build step. What has
  no logical equivalent and still needs `rtl:` overrides: `transform`/`translateX`,
  `background-position`, gradients, `box-shadow` offsets, directional icons.
- **Do not use raw Unicode isolates.** For gap "zero bidi isolates", the fix is
  `<bdi>` in JSX, not `\u2068`/`\u2069`. The HTML spec is explicit that authors
  should not hand-maintain bidi formatting characters — they interact poorly with
  CSS. `<bdi>` with no `dir` *is* `dir=auto` *is* FSI…PDI. Relatedly, `dir` must be
  markup on `<html>` and never CSS (W3C normative), and `lang` does **not** imply
  direction.

## Open questions

1. Is a proprietary-model dependency acceptable for the quality screen? If not,
   CompactQE (2026) does interpretable QE with small open-weight LLMs.
2. What human review sampling rate sits on top of the automatic screen? MQM
   convention is 500–20,000 words per evaluation.
3. Should `pt` be renamed `pt-BR` so `pt-PT` stops resolving to it confidently?
4. Does the Electron main process get its own minimal catalog (~30 strings), or do
   native menus stay English?
