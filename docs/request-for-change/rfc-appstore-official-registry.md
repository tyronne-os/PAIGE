# RFC: Official App Registry + Editorial Feed

> **Current behaviour: see [`../system-specs/modules/app-kit-platform.md`](../system-specs/modules/app-kit-platform.md)**
> for the official-catalog and editorial surface that ships. Signature
> verification and tombstone resolution are deliberately absent and fail
> closed. §4 carries its own revision note naming the four category decisions

**Author:** KiroCrew contributors
**Date:** 2026-07-29
**Status:** partial, **and diverged** — this document's failure mode is the first one the [directory README](README.md) names: *the plan was overtaken.* Rollout step R1 shipped **in the sibling `kirodotdev/KiroCrewApps` repo**, but §4 was reversed on four decisions while it did, so §4 is now a record of what was decided rather than a description of the contract. **Read the note at the head of §4 before trusting anything below about categories.** The schema files in that repository are the current source of truth.

On the Kiro Crew side, R3 and R4 are no longer unstarted as this line previously said, but neither is finished. The official **fetch** is live and so is editorial-driven Discover (`apps/official_catalog.py`, `apps/official_editorial.py`). The **signature gate is not**: that module's own header lists three deliberate omissions, and the first is "No signature verification" — the `.sig` sidecar is published and nothing checks it, so trust is TLS to our own domain, and the consequence is enforced rather than ignored (a curated author does not mint the verified mark while that holds). **Tombstone resolution is absent** on the same terms: a document carrying a non-empty `removed` or `reinstated` list is refused outright rather than half-resolved. The rail order's own document is published but not yet read by any client — the client still resolves category order from the editorial document, so that one URL exists ahead of its consumer by design.

## 1. Problem Statement

The App Store's catalog and its merchandising are frozen into each KiroCrew
release. Two concrete gaps:

1. **No first-party remote registry.** The curated catalog is the bundled
   `kiro_crew/apps/app-registry.json`, compiled into the wheel next to
   `registry.py` (`_REGISTRY_FILE`). Changing the catalog — adding an app,
   fixing a repo URL, pulling a broken one — requires shipping a new app
   release. User-configured *external* registries exist
   (`ExternalRegistryConfig`: `name`/`repo`/`branch`, git-clone based) but are
   deliberately **untrusted**: `pickFeatured()` in `AppsPage.tsx` drops every
   `_registry`-marked entry (`a => !a._registry`), and install/browse clone
   them credential-free behind the SSRF + kebab-case + subdirectory-containment
   gates. There is no source that is both *remote* (updatable out of band) and
   *trusted* (allowed to drive featuring).

2. **No official editorial recommendation, and no versioned presentation
   contract.** "Featured" today is a `featured` flag/number on **bundled**
   entries plus a client-side `pickFeatured()` heuristic — baked into the
   frontend and the shipped index. There is no hosted, curator-driven feed for
   the Discover page, and no schema version on the store's presentation layer,
   so we cannot change *how the App Store page looks or works* without shipping
   a new client. (The only `schemaVersion` in `apps/` is on the installed-app
   record in `manager.py`, unrelated to the catalog or the store UI.)

### Goals

- A KiroCrew-owned **official registry** the client pulls at runtime, trusted
  enough to drive featuring, updatable without an app release.
- A KiroCrew-owned **editorial feed** describing the Discover page
  declaratively, that is **fail-safe** (degrades gracefully when unreachable or
  malformed) and **schema-versioned** (new layouts reach new clients while old
  clients keep working).
- Both decoupled from the app-release cadence, with a clean curation trust
  boundary.
- An **effective removal path**: pulling an app must take effect without a client
  release, and must survive the stale-cache fallback.
- Room for **multiple hosting sources** for an app's bytes (internal git farms,
  artifact stores / S3, OCI) without a breaking schema change. Additional
  *catalog* sources stay an operator concern — config or build time, never named
  by a fetched document (§3.3).

### Non-goals

- The app *loading* model (ESM/import maps, bundle hashing). That is
  [rfc-federated-app-platform](./rfc-federated-app-platform.md); this RFC is a
  companion covering the **source of the catalog + its merchandising**, not how
  an app's UI is loaded. **Precedence:** where the two overlap on the wire format,
  this RFC's document envelope and entry schema (§3) supersede that RFC's §3.7
  registry sketch, **and this RFC owns the `app.json` additions in §3.7** —
  superseding that RFC's §3.3 manifest table, which `AppManifest` has already
  outgrown (its one substantive manifest change, removing `backend`, never shipped,
  and the live manifest carries fields the table never lists). The authoritative
  manifest is `AppManifest` in code, not either RFC's table. Concretely: §3.7 adds
  `resources`/`lifecycle`/`platform.externalInstall`/`searchAliases` and widens
  `author` to a struct; integer `schemaVersion` replaces its string
  `"version"`, entry display fields are **generated** into the index from each app's
  `app.json` (§3.4) rather than hand-authored, and
  its flat `bundleUrl` + `bundleHash` map onto `source.type: "bundle"` with
  `integrity`. Its trust-tier vocabulary is reconciled in §5.
- Third-party/community registry trust changes. User-configured external
  registries stay untrusted exactly as today.

---

## 2. Where things live

Split by layer, not lumped into one repo. The repo split is **decided**; the
snapshot-sync mechanism in the third row is still open (§8, *snapshot-sync
mechanism*):

| Layer | Home | Contents |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Contract (schema)** | `KiroCrewApps` *(now; migrates to `KiroCrewAppSDK` later)* | JSON Schema + generated TS types for the registry entry and the editorial document. Starts co-located with the data it validates; extracted to the SDK once there are external consumers (published app-author tooling). |
| **Data (source of truth)** | `KiroCrewApps` | `official-registry.json` + `editorial.json`, hand-curated. A publish CI workflow validates against the co-located schema and pushes to the distribution CDN. |
| **Client + fallback** | `KiroCrew` | Fetch / validate / layered-fallback code, **plus** the bundled fallback snapshot `kiro_crew/apps/app-registry.json`, which is **generated** from `KiroCrewApps` at build time (or a bot sync PR) — never hand-authored, so the offline floor cannot drift from canonical. |

Rationale: the entire premise of goal 1 is to decouple catalog + merchandising
cadence from app releases. Co-locating the data in `KiroCrew` re-couples them —
every catalog tweak or featured swap would go through the product repo's
CODEOWNERS, review, and commit history, and force curators (PM/devrel) to hold
product-code write access. A dedicated catalog repo gives a separate write/trust
boundary and a clean audit trail. Precedent: Obsidian's `obsidian-releases`
holds `community-plugins.json` + featured lists separate from the app; Homebrew
taps; Raycast's extensions repo. `KiroCrewApps` already exists (currently an
empty stub) as the intended home.

The schema **starts in `KiroCrewApps`, co-located with the data it validates**,
and migrates to `KiroCrewAppSDK` later. Its only consumer at launch is the
catalog's own validate-and-publish workflow; the client read-path and published
app-author tooling that would justify a separately-versioned SDK package aren't
wired yet. Keeping it next to the data avoids a premature cross-repo release
dependency and a version-skew surface while the contract is still churning. The
migration is mechanical (move the schema files, publish them from the SDK,
repoint the validator import) and the tolerant-reader/additive rules in §4 keep
the on-the-wire `schemaVersion` stable across the move — so nothing consuming a
published doc has to change when the schema's *home* changes.

### Authoring surface ≠ serving surface (generated publish)

The CDN artifact is **generated by CI from the curated files**, not the curated
file copied verbatim. Curators edit a human-friendly source of truth in
`KiroCrewApps`; the publish workflow emits the machine-facing document:

```
KiroCrewApps (authored, reviewed)
   → CI: validate against schema · normalize · resolve · stamp · integrity · SIGN
      → published document on the CDN (generated, immutable per revision)
         → client fetch  /  generated bundled snapshot in KiroCrew
```

What the generator adds that hand-authoring cannot guarantee:

- **schema validation as a merge gate** — an invalid catalog can't reach clients;
- **normalization** — legacy flat entries folded to the tagged `source` union
  (§3.1) once, at publish time, so the client's compatibility path is a thin
  safety net rather than the main road;
- **`generatedAt` / revision stamping** and a digest, so a client (and the
  bundled-snapshot generator) can tell two payloads apart;
- **referential checks** — every editorial `appRef` and every `replacedBy`
  resolves to a live entry, and no entry is simultaneously listed and tombstoned;
- **the detached signature** over the published bytes. Signing is part of this
  pipeline from the first publish (§7 step 1), not a later addition — the client
  refuses to grant Official trust to an unsigned document (§5), so an unsigned
  publish would simply produce a feed nobody honors.

Precedent: Homebrew authors formulae in a git tap and serves a *generated* JSON
API from `formulae.brew.sh`; the tap is never the read surface. Same split here.

Two consequences worth stating: published documents must be treated as
**immutable per revision** (never rewrite a published payload with different
bytes — that is the CloudFront edge-skew failure mode the release system already
learned), and the bundled fallback snapshot in `KiroCrew` is generated from the
*published* document, not from the authored file, so the offline floor is
byte-consistent with what the CDN serves.

---

## 3. Registry schema

The registry answers exactly two questions per app: **what it is** (identity) and
**where its bytes come from** (source). Everything else lives elsewhere, and the
division is what keeps each document editable by the right party:

| Concern | Home | Who edits |
|---|---|---|
| Identity + byte source | this document | curator |
| What the app *is* (display, runtime shape, external presence) | the app's own `app.json` (§3.7) | app author |
| How the store *features* apps (the Discover layout) | `editorial.json` (§4) | curator |
| What order the category rail runs in | `category-order.json` | curator |
| Which category an app is in (membership) | the app's own registry entry | curator |

Three rules fall out, and each closes a specific hole:

- **No curator-authored presentation in the catalog.** The Discover layout lives
  in `editorial.json` and the rail order in `category-order.json`, so re-ordering
  a category is an editorial edit rather than a client release. Two corrections to
  what this rule originally claimed, both covered in the note at §4: **membership**
  is stated on the registry entry, not in editorial; and **re-labelling** is not an
  editorial edit at all, because a label has to exist in every language the
  dashboard ships. This is deliberately *not* a claim that no display text lives in
  the catalog: the generated search subset (§3.4) does, and changing an app's own
  `displayName`/`summary` therefore does ride a republish — that is the price of
  letting Discover search without a per-app manifest fetch.
- **No executable strings in the catalog.** The client never runs a command
  supplied by a fetched document (§3.7 replaces the one that existed).
- **Generated, not authored.** Display fields still appear in the *published*
  document — baked at publish time from the app's `app.json` (§3.4) — but a
  curator never types them and an app author never edits this file.

The canonical published schema is **generic and host-neutral** — no
Amazon/Brazil constructs.

### 3.1 Entry shape — tagged `source` union

Where an app's bytes come from is a **discriminated union** under `source`, not a
set of flat sibling URL fields. Only `type: "git"` is defined in v1; the
discriminator exists from day one so a second transport is additive:

```jsonc
// one registry entry (canonical, public)
{
  "name": "oncall-radar",            // unique id, lowercase kebab-case
  "source": {
    "type": "git",                   // the enum
    "url": "https://github.com/acme/oncall-radar.git", // any git-cloneable URL
    "ref": "3f2a1c9…",               // MUST be an immutable commit id (see below)
    "subdir": ""                     // optional
  }
  // Runtime shape and external-presence detection are NOT here — they describe
  // the app, so they live in its app.json (§3.7). Display fields are baked in
  // at publish time (§3.4). Category membership is the `categories` key below.
}
```

Reserved variants, each carrying **its own** pinning/auth fields — which is the
whole reason for the union, since a `sha256` is meaningless for git and a `ref`
is meaningless for a tarball:

```jsonc
{ "type": "archive", "url": "https://…/app-1.2.0.tar.gz", "sha256": "…" }
{ "type": "s3",      "bucket": "…", "key": "…/app-1.2.0.tar.gz", "region": "…", "sha256": "…" }
{ "type": "oci",     "ref": "registry.example/acme/app:1.2.0", "digest": "sha256:…" }
{ "type": "bundle",  "url": "https://…/index.mjs", "integrity": "sha384-…" }
```

Notes that make this work in practice:

- **Internal git farms need no new type.** `type: "git"` takes any cloneable
  URL, so a self-hosted forge is already expressible. What an internal host
  actually needs is *host trust*, not a new transport — see the axis note below.
- **`s3` is a separate type rather than an `archive` with an `s3://` URL**
  because its auth model differs (SigV4 with a region and an explicit credential
  grant vs an anonymous HTTPS GET). Collapsing them would recreate exactly the
  "which fields apply?" ambiguity the union exists to remove. Note that needing
  credentials at all makes `s3` gated on §8's *per-repository credential grants*
  question — the tier never supplies them (§5).
- **`ref` MUST be an immutable commit id for official entries.** A
  branch name is a *mutable* pointer, so a signed index naming `main` signs
  nothing about the bytes: whoever can push to that branch changes what a
  "verified" app installs, and the app's `setup.onInstall` then runs unreviewed
  code. Signing the index is only meaningful if the index pins content. The
  publish pipeline (§2) **resolves the curator's branch/tag to a commit id at
  publish time** and emits that — so curators still author `main` and the
  published document always carries a pin. Updating an app is therefore an
  explicit republish, which is also what makes the catalog auditable. A mutable
  `ref` is tolerated only for untrusted user-external entries (where nothing is
  vouched for anyway) and local development.
- **Every variant must be content-pinned**, not just git: `sha256` for `archive`
  and `s3`, `digest` for `oci`, `integrity` for `bundle`. "Signed index pointing
  at unpinned content" is the same defect in each.
- **Unknown `type` fails closed.** An entry whose `source.type` the client
  doesn't recognize is dropped from the installable set — never partially
  handled. Because dropping an *entry* hides an app (unlike dropping an editorial
  section, which only hides a layout), the UI should surface "N apps require a
  newer KiroCrew" rather than silently shrinking the catalog.
- **Every new type costs a fetcher + a trust gate**, not just a schema variant.
  Adding one is a client change; the schema slot alone doesn't make it live.
- **The v1 JSON Schema must model `source` as a *closed* discriminated union** —
  `oneOf` on `type`, `additionalProperties: false` per variant, and each variant's
  pinning field (`sha256` / `digest` / `integrity`) marked `required`. Without
  that, "additive" is an unchecked assertion: a loosely-modelled `source` would
  happily validate an `archive` entry with no digest, i.e. an unpinned download.

**Legacy flat form stays accepted** as sugar, normalized in one place in the
reader, so the existing bundled file and the internal catalog keep working with
no migration and no schema-major bump:

```
{ gitUrl | repo, branch }  →  { source: { type: "git", url, ref } }
```

### 3.2 Three orthogonal axes — don't conflate them

| Axis | Question | Where it lives |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Transport** | how are the bytes fetched? | `source.type` (§3.1) |
| **Host trust** | may we fetch from this host, and with whose credentials? | client-side trusted-host allowlist (public forges ∪ owner-configured registries ∪ edition-contributed internal hosts) |
| **Catalog trust** | who vouches for this entry? | trust tier (§5) |

An internal git farm or internal artifact store is a **host-trust** change (add
the host to the allowlist, decide the credential posture), not a transport
change. Keeping these separate is what stops a transport enum from quietly
implying "and it's safe to send credentials there."

### 3.3 Where registry SOURCES come from (not from this document)

A registry document lists **apps**. It does **not** list other registries. Adding
a catalog source is an **operator** decision, made in owner config or at build
time — never something a fetched document can do.

There are exactly two ways a source enters the set, both of which already exist:

| Mechanism | Where | Trust | Who decides |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Owner config** | `registries: [{name, repo, branch}]` (`ExternalRegistryConfig`) | untrusted (§5) | the machine's owner |
| **Edition / build time** | the `AppsLoader.registry_rows()` CPP seam (`_edition_registry_rows()`), merged add-only | edition-designated | whoever composes the build |

An internal git-farm catalog is therefore an **edition** concern: an internal
build contributes its rows through the existing seam, or the operator adds the
registry to their own config. Either way the decision is local.

**Why the official document must NOT carry a `delegates[]` list.** An earlier
draft of this RFC did exactly that, and it was wrong on three counts:

1. **It duplicates a mechanism that already exists.** Owner config and the
   edition seam already cover both federation cases. A third path only creates
   precedence questions between them.
2. **It hands a remote document the power to add fetch targets.** The client
   would fetch URLs it was told about by a document, not by its owner. That
   converts a catalog into a redirector: a compromised (or merely
   over-enthusiastic) first-party publish could point the entire fleet at new
   hosts, including internal ones. Signing the document does not fix this — it
   authenticates *who said it*, not whether the owner ever wanted those hosts
   contacted.
3. **It lets a document confer trust.** Trust in a source must be granted by the
   party who owns the machine, not asserted by content arriving over the network.
   A `trust: "official"` field is that inversion written down.

The blast-radius argument is the decisive one. Without delegation, a compromise
of the signing key means *lies about apps the client already knows about*. With
delegation, the same compromise means *new fetch origins, at official trust*.
That is a categorically larger failure, bought for a capability the config and
edition seams already provide.

Dropping delegation also removes the machinery that existed only to contain it:
per-delegate signing keys, delegate digest pinning, depth caps, breadth caps,
fetch-concurrency budgets, and the taxonomy-override rule for delegate-supplied
categories. None of that is needed once the document stops naming sources.

**Catalog size is a separate problem.** If the official catalog ever outgrows one
document, that is *sharding* — parts enumerated under the same signature and the
same origin — not federation of third-party catalogs. It does not require naming
other registries and does not expand the trust set.

### 3.4 Baked search fields (generated, never authored)

The "identity + source only" rule has one necessary exception, for the reason
every comparable store has it: **you cannot search or list a catalog you have not
fetched.** Discover renders a dense sortable list, a category rail and a search
box over *every* app before the user clicks anything. If display data lived only
in each app's `app.json`, the client would have to fetch N remote manifests to
paint the first screen — today that means a throwaway shallow clone per app.

So the published document carries a small **denormalized search subset** per
entry, and the rule that keeps it honest is that it is **generated**:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "oncall-radar",
  "source": { /* … */ },
  // ── baked at publish time from the app's own app.json ──
  "displayName": "Oncall Radar",
  "summary": "Surfaces your oncall pages in one place.",   // short, list-safe
  "author": { "name": "acme", "url": "https://acme.dev", "kind": "org" },
  "tags": ["ops", "oncall"],            // author-declared, VISIBLE as facets
  "searchAliases": ["pager", "pagerduty"], // invisible synonyms, never rendered
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "iconRef": "…", "heroRef": "…"        // resolved media pointers
}
```

- **Generated, not hand-maintained.** The publish pipeline (§2) already fetches
  and resolves each entry, so it bakes these from the app's own `app.json`. App
  authors still never edit the catalog — they edit their manifest, and the next
  publish picks it up. Precedent: Obsidian's `community-plugins.json` carries
  `name`/`author`/`description` explicitly *for search*, and Homebrew serves a
  fully generated JSON API off its tap.
- **Advisory cache, not authority.** On the detail page the app's live manifest
  wins; the baked copy exists for list/search/first-paint. Long-form fields
  (screenshots, highlights, body) stay lazy and are never baked.
- **`author` is structured from the start.** A bare string cannot carry a link or
  distinguish a person from an org, and widening `string` → `object` later is a
  breaking change while starting structured is not. A legacy bare string is
  accepted on read and normalized to `{ name }` at publish.
- **`searchAliases` are not tags.** Tags are a *visible* filter facet; aliases are
  invisible synonyms ("deck", "powerpoint"). Overloading tags would put synonyms
  in the UI as filter chips.
- **Security bonus.** Because the baked fields live *inside the signed document*,
  they are signed claims: a compromised app repo cannot silently change what the
  store displays until a republish. Strictly better than rendering unsigned text
  fetched from an arbitrary repo at browse time.
- **Staleness is bounded and visible.** The baked copy is only as fresh as the
  last publish — the same cadence that already governs the pin in §3.1, so a
  version bump and a description change land together by construction.

**Category membership was deliberately absent here, and is not any more.** This
section originally placed taxonomy *and* membership in `editorial.json` (§4), for
two reasons: assigning a category is a merchandising decision rather than a
property of the app, and keeping membership beside the taxonomy made the reference
check intra-document. The first reason still holds and is why membership is
curator-assigned; the second was traded away. Membership is now a `categories`
array on the entry, so an app and its placement are one edit and a reference to an
app that does not exist cannot be written down -- and the reference check became
cross-document, which the publish gate performs. See the note at §4.


### 3.5 Document wrapper

The document wrapper carries the schema version and a generator stamp:

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-29T19:00:00Z",
  "apps": [ /* entries */ ],
  "removed": [ /* tombstones, §3.6 */ ],
  "reinstated": [ /* reinstatement records, §3.6 */ ]
}
```

There IS a `categories` key -- see the note at §4; this sentence described the
original design, where the vocabulary and the membership both sat in
`editorial.json`. The vocabulary now lives in `category-order.json`. There is
no `delegates` key either (§3.3).

A bare top-level array (today's format) is still accepted and read as
`schemaVersion: 1, apps: <array>` so nothing breaks during rollout.

### 3.6 Tombstones (`removed`) — pulling an app must be positive information

An entry **disappearing** from the index is not a usable removal signal, and the
fail-safe ladder makes that worse rather than better:

- absence is ambiguous — pulled deliberately, or a truncated/failed fetch?
- the stale-cache fallback means a client that can't reach the CDN keeps serving
  the *old* index, so **a pulled app would keep showing indefinitely**;
- an already-installed app gets no signal at all, since install state is local.

So removal is carried as **explicit, positive** data that survives caching and
merge:

```jsonc
"removed": [
  {
    "name": "abandoned-app",
    "reason": "deprecated",        // "deprecated" | "superseded" | "withdrawn" | "malicious"
    "since": "2026-07-20",
    "note": "No longer maintained; use oncall-radar.",
    "replacedBy": "oncall-radar",  // optional
    "advice": "keep"               // "keep" | "disable" | "uninstall"
  }
]
```

Semantics:

- A tombstone **wins over an entry of the same `name` from any lower-or-equal
  tier**, including a stale cached one — this is what makes a pull effective
  without a client release.
- `reason: "malicious"` with `advice: "uninstall"` is the yank path: the app
  leaves Discover *and* the installed app is flagged with a prominent warning.
  Everything milder leaves installed copies working (`advice: "keep"`) and only
  removes the app from discovery.
- Tombstones are **persisted append-only on the client and never cleared by
  omission**. A newer valid document that simply *stops listing* a tombstone does
  NOT clear it — otherwise one document (or one truncated/rolled-back publish)
  silently resurrects a yanked app, including a `malicious` one. Un-removing an
  app requires an **explicit validated reinstatement record** naming it; only that
  deletes the persisted tombstone. A failed fetch obviously cannot resurrect
  anything either.
- **Tombstones and reinstatement records are permanently append-only.** A client
  can be offline arbitrarily long, so "keep it as long as some client might still
  hold the tombstone" has no finite bound — stating it as a *window* would let an
  implementation prune reinstatements and strand those clients suppressing an app
  forever. They are therefore never pruned. Growth is negligible (a handful of
  short records) and the alternative — a bounded supported-client age plus a
  checkpoint protocol for clients older than it — is real complexity to buy back
  bytes we do not need. If the list ever does need bounding, that checkpoint
  protocol is the mechanism, not silent pruning.
- Precedent: Obsidian keeps `community-plugins-removed.json` and
  `community-plugin-deprecation.json` as separate first-class documents rather
  than relying on absence.

`removed` lives **inline in the registry document** (§3.5) — one fetch, one atomic
view, so there is no way to hold a fresh index against a stale tombstone list.

### 3.7 What moves to `app.json` (manifest additions)

Three fields that were in the registry describe **the app**, not the catalog, and
belong in the app's own manifest. Two of them are not `AppManifest` fields today,
which is itself the finding: they were only ever *derived*.

| Field | Today | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| `resources` | not declared in `AppManifest`; derived from the installed record, or hardcoded for externally-detected apps | declared in `app.json` |
| `lifecycle` | same | declared in `app.json` |
| `detectInstalled` | a **shell command** in the registry, executed on the listing path | replaced by declarative `platform.externalInstall` |

**`resources` / `lifecycle`.** These decide whether KiroCrew copies files and
registers resources or the app self-registers. Their current wiring is thinner
than it looks:

- entry `resources` has exactly **one** read-site — `is_self_managed` in
  `install_from_registry` — which runs on **install and update**, not just first
  install;
- entry `lifecycle` has **no** read-site at all. The listing enrichment only ever
  *writes* it (from the installed record for installed rows, or hardcoded for
  externally-detected ones), so as a registry field it is currently dead weight;
- neither is a declared `AppManifest` field, so neither has an authoritative home
  today.

`install_from_registry` already fetches the manifest before it reads `resources`,
so declaring both in `app.json` costs no extra fetch, gives `lifecycle` a real
home instead of a write-only one, and puts the decision where the app author can
state it.

**`detectInstalled` → `platform.externalInstall`.** A shell command supplied by a
fetched document and run by the client is the same class of mistake as the
`delegates[]` list removed in §3.3: the document reaching into client *behavior*
rather than describing apps. It is also self-evidently app knowledge ("does my
bundle exist at this path"). The replacement is declarative and evaluated by
KiroCrew, never by a shell:

```jsonc
"platform": {
  "externalInstall": {
    "macos": { "bundleId": "dev.kiro.OncallRadar" },
    "linux": { "binary": "oncall-radar" }
  }
}
```

This is what comparable systems do. Homebrew records manager-installed state in a
local per-keg `INSTALL_RECEIPT.json` and reads local state rather than probing;
Homebrew Cask declares artifacts as *stanzas* from which paths are derived. iOS is
the strongest form: `canOpenURL` only answers for schemes pre-declared in
`LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`, and the **OS** performs the lookup — a design Apple
adopted in iOS 9 specifically because arbitrary probing had been abused to
fingerprint installed apps. Our `detectInstalled` is that same shape — a probe
supplied by a third party — and it runs on the *listing* path (for every entry
that declares one and is not already locally installed), not just at install.

So installed-state resolution becomes: **local receipt** (apps KiroCrew installed
— already the source of truth) **∪ declarative probe** (`externalInstall`,
evaluated natively). Conservative by default: detect and report, never act.
Homebrew Cask's own history is the caution — a pre-existing-artifact check once
tripped an uninstall path and deleted the user's app.

Also declared in `app.json` and baked at publish (§3.4): `searchAliases`, and
`author` in its structured form. **`author` is a widening of a live field**, not a
new one: `AppManifest.author` is `str` today, so the manifest gains an object form
while the bare string stays valid on read and is normalized to `{ name }` at
publish. `resources`, `lifecycle`, `platform.externalInstall` and `searchAliases`
are additions.

**Ownership.** These additions land in *this* RFC (see Non-goals). The sibling
`rfc-federated-app-platform` §3.3 manifest table is stale rather than
authoritative: `AppManifest` implements most of what it sketches but has moved past
it — the table's one substantive manifest change (removing `backend`) never
shipped, and live fields such as `publishProvider`, `notifications`, `dependencies`
and `signer`/`signature` appear nowhere in it. Treating a stale table as the
manifest contract would gate this change on a document already overtaken by the
code. Ground truth is `AppManifest`; this RFC amends it.

**Legacy entries keep a defined read rule.** Every other superseded shape in this
document has one — flat `source` (§3.1), bare-string `author` (§3.4), bare
top-level array (§3.5) — so these need one too. A `resources` value on an entry is
**ignored** in favour of the manifest; `lifecycle` and `detectInstalled` on an entry
are **ignored outright** (`lifecycle` has no read-site today, and `detectInstalled`
is the key being removed). Ignoring rather than honoring is the safe direction, but
it is a behaviour change for external and edition catalogs that rely on
`detectInstalled` for external-app detection, so the deprecation path is an open
question (§8).

---

## 4. Editorial schema (fail-safe + versioned)

`editorial.json` is a **presentation manifest**, decoupled from the raw index.
It only *references* apps by `name`; actual app data always resolves through the
registry. Editorial can therefore never inject a phantom or spoofed app — it can
only arrange apps that already exist and pass admission (this contains the same
class of featured-spoof vector already handled by the App Store's app-trust
checks).

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "minClientVersion": "0.1.2",     // client below this ignores the doc entirely
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-29T19:00:00Z",
  "sections": [
    { "type": "spotlight", "appRef": "oncall-radar", "blurb": "…" },
    { "type": "rail", "title": "Made by the team", "appRefs": ["pptx-maker", "meetnote"] },
    { "type": "banner", "md": "New: **Channels**", "cta": { "label": "Learn more", "href": "…" } },
  ],
  "categories": [                        // taxonomy AND membership (below)
    { "id": "ops", "label": "Ops", "order": 10, "appRefs": ["oncall-radar"] }
  ]
}
```

### The taxonomy lives here, with membership

`categories[]` carries both the vocabulary and which apps are in it. This closes
the hardcoded-category-taxonomy gap tracked in **issue #581**, where the list
currently lives in frontend source.

Putting membership next to the taxonomy buys three things:

- **Single-category becomes a checkable invariant.** The publish step asserts the
  flattened membership list has no duplicates, so an app in two categories is a
  detectable curation error rather than a convention nobody enforces. A
  partitioned rail is the point; **cross-cutting placement is what a `rail`
  section is for** ("Staff picks"), which is how an app appears in more than one
  place without multi-category membership.
- **No separate ordering section.** `categories[].order` carries the sequence, so
  the `category-order` section type is removed as redundant. `order` must be
  **unique** across `categories[]` (a publish-gate check); if two entries ever tie,
  **array order breaks the tie**, so the rendered sequence is deterministic from
  the document alone and two clients cannot disagree.
- **Authors cannot self-promote — a change, not a restatement.** Today membership
  is *derived from author-supplied tags*: `categories.ts` holds both the hardcoded
  `CATEGORY_ORDER` (issue #581) and a tag→category `MATCHERS` map, and
  `categoryFor(app.tags)` is what the filter, the sort and three card surfaces call.
  An author can therefore place their own app in a rail today by choosing tags.
  Curator-assigned membership removes that, and the tag-derived matcher is deleted —
  not just the label list. §6 covers what replaces it.

Tolerant reading applies here too: an app in no category falls into a default
bucket and is **never hidden**. Nothing references a category by *label*, so
relabeling is a catalog edit.

### Schema-evolution rules ("change how the page looks/works")

The design principle that makes layout changes safe without breaking old
clients is the **tolerant reader** with **additive-only** evolution:

1. **Data-driven sections.** The page is a `sections[]` array of typed objects,
   not a fixed template. New layouts = new `type` values.
2. **Skip-unknown.** The client renders `type`s it knows and **silently drops**
   unknown ones. A new `type: "carousel"` reaches new clients and is invisible
   (not broken) on old ones.
3. **Additive-only within a major.** New fields are optional; existing fields
   never change meaning. Bump `schemaVersion` **major** only for a breaking
   change; a major the client doesn't support triggers full fallback (§4
   ladder), not a partial render.
4. **`minClientVersion` gate.** Lets the server force older clients onto their
   bundled default when a doc relies on behavior they lack, independent of the
   schema major.
5. **Per-section validation, not all-or-nothing.** A section that fails
   validation (unknown required field, `appRef` that doesn't resolve, malformed
   `md`) is dropped individually; the rest of the page still renders.

The contract (allowed `type`s, required/optional fields per type, the tolerant-
reader + additive rules) is the JSON Schema in `KiroCrewApps` (co-located with
the data now, migrating to `KiroCrewAppSDK` later — §2), so
client, curator tooling, and validator share one definition.

### Fail-safe fallback ladder

Every layer is a *validated overlay*; the store never hard-fails:

```
live fetch (official editorial doc, CDN)
  → validated last-known-good disk cache      (stale > missing)
    → bundled default editorial snapshot        (compiled floor)
      → built-in client-side heuristic            (always renders something)
```

This reuses the **fetch-then-swap** refresh discipline the registry already
uses: the cache is overwritten only on a successful, validated fetch, so a
network blip degrades to "slightly stale," never "apps vanished." Validation on
**read** (not just fetch) guards a hand-tampered or older-build cache file,
mirroring the registry's existing cached-entry re-validation (name + path-safety
gates).

---

## 5. Trust tiers

The official registry needs a tier **between** bundled and user-external:

| Tier | Source | Featuring / editorial | Clone credentials | Authenticity |
|------|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Bundled** | compiled `app-registry.json` | honored | ambient (owner-designated) | ships in the wheel |
| **Official** *(new)* | KiroCrew-owned CDN doc | **honored** (only once the signature verifies) | **credential-free + strict sandbox** | host-pin **and** required detached signature |
| **External (user)** | user-configured repos | ignored | credential-free + strict sandbox | none |

Two properties of this table are load-bearing and were nearly got wrong:

**Catalog trust never implies credential posture.** Only the *bundled* tier gets
ambient git/ssh credentials, because only bundled entries are
owner-designated-at-build-time. Every remotely-fetched entry — official,
edition, or user-external — clones **credential-free in a strict sandbox**.
This matches what the code already decided:
`index_originated = bool(entry.get("_registry"))` in `install_from_registry`
forces the credential-free path precisely because an index entry can name a
private *sibling* repo on a host that is already trusted, and cloning it with the
gateway's identity would read that private repo as a confused deputy. An official
entry is index-authored by construction, so granting it ambient credentials
would reopen exactly that hole. If ambient credentials are ever needed for an internal source, they
require an explicit **per-repository** grant, never a tier-wide one.

**Host-pinning alone does not authenticate the bytes.** A fixed first-party
origin defeats a network attacker with no valid certificate for that hostname. It
does **not** defeat a DNS or CDN-origin takeover, or a compromised bucket — those
serve valid TLS from the pinned hostname, and the client would accept unsigned
documents that grant attacker entries Official featuring and point installs at
attacker-controlled code. Therefore a **detached signature** (minisign/cosign over
the doc bytes, rooted in an offline key shipped in the client — see below) is **required before Official
trust is granted**, not a fast-follow. An official document that fails signature
verification is treated as absent — the client falls through the §4 ladder to its
cached/bundled state rather than honoring unverified featuring.

**Key rotation must not re-couple yanking to an app release — but an OR-set of
keys is the wrong way to get there.** A naive "ship two keys, accept either"
scheme is strictly *worse* than one key: it grants the not-yet-active key signing
power immediately, so compromising **either** key is sufficient to forge a
catalog, and a static set carries no way to revoke. The model instead separates
the trust root from the signing key:

- The client ships an **offline root public key**. The corresponding private key
  is held offline, used rarely, and never touches publish CI.
- The root signs a small **key-metadata document** that designates **exactly one
  active document-signing key**, with an explicit activation time and expiry.
- The catalog and editorial documents are signed by the *active signing key*. A
  client accepts a document only if the signing key is the one the current,
  unexpired, root-signed metadata designates.
- **Rotation is a publish**: sign and publish new key metadata naming the new
  signing key. No app release. **Revocation is the same act** — superseding the
  metadata withdraws the old key, which the OR-set could not express.
- Only compromise of the **root** key requires a client update. Compromise of a
  signing key is recoverable in-band, which is what keeps the yank path decoupled
  from the release train.
- Metadata carries expiry so stale-but-validly-signed key metadata cannot be replayed
  forever; an expired metadata document is treated like a missing one (fall
  through the §4 ladder, grant no Official trust).

This is the standard root-vs-signing-key split (as in TUF and comparable update
frameworks); the operational details of custody and CI gating remain open in §8.

Relationship to `rfc-federated-app-platform` §5.2's tiers: its **Built-in** ≈
this RFC's Bundled, **Curated** ≈ Official, and **Local** ≈ a locally-installed
path (out of scope here). Its **Community** ("medium trust, hash-pinned") has *no*
equivalent here — this RFC's External (user) tier is **untrusted**, not
medium-trust. The
two documents must not be read as using one shared tier vocabulary.

---

## 6. Client changes (KiroCrew)

- **One authenticated fetcher, one cache dir, one validator** for both docs,
  reusing the manifest-cache machinery (`_manifest_cache_dir()`, atomic writes,
  TTL, fetch-then-swap). Editorial and official-registry are two files under the
  same cache root. Signature verification (§5) gates acceptance.
- **Replace the `_registry` boolean with an explicit tier.** This is a
  prerequisite, not a detail. Today `_registry` is overloaded three ways: it is
  the featuring filter (`!a._registry` in `pickFeatured()`), the verified-badge
  rejection (`isVerified()` in `components/appstore/types.ts` returns `false` on
  any `_registry`, with tests locking that ordering in), **and** the backend's
  credential-posture key (`index_originated`). An official entry arrives through
  the same fetch-and-merge machinery, so it would carry `_registry` and land
  un-featurable *and* badged unverified — the exact opposite of §5 and §9. Fix:
  carry `_tier: 'bundled' | 'edition' | 'official' | 'external'`, and gate each consumer on the tier it actually cares about
  (featuring/badging on catalog trust; cloning on credential posture, which is
  ambient for `bundled` only). The existing tests that encode the boolean
  ordering must be updated deliberately, not incidentally.
- **Merge order** in `list_registry()`: bundled → **edition rows** → official →
  external (§3.3), each add-only over the previous (dedupe by
  `name`). The edition seam is not optional to name: `_load_registry_file()`
  already merges edition/CPP rows into the bundled list add-only, so live code has
  four sources and this ladder must say where a CDN document sits relative to an
  internal edition row. Decision: **an edition row wins over an official row of
  the same `name`** (an internal deployment's own catalog is more specific than the
  public one).
- **Tombstone suppression belongs in the shared entry-lookup path, not only in
  `list_registry()`.** `get_registry_app()` is a separate synchronous lookup over
  the bundled file + external caches and is what install-by-name resolves against;
  filtering only the list path would leave a `reason: "malicious"` app hidden from
  Discover yet still installable by name. Tombstones are applied after the full
  merge in *both* paths.
- **List/search reads the baked fields; detail reads the live manifest** (§3.4).
  The Discover list, search, and category rail render entirely from the published
  document — no per-app manifest fetch on browse. The lazy manifest fetch stays,
  but only for the detail view, where it supersedes the baked copy.
- **Categories come from the EDITORIAL document** (§4), replacing both the
  hardcoded `CATEGORY_ORDER` and the tag→category `MATCHERS` derivation in
  `website/src/components/appstore/categories.ts` (issue #581). This is a
  **total-function → lookup** change and needs care: `categoryFor(app.tags)` always
  returns a category today, whereas curator-enumerated `appRefs[]` does not cover
  every app. So the migration must supply (a) a `name → category` map built from
  the editorial document, since `sort: 'category'` and three card surfaces
  (`AppListRow`, `FeatureCard`, `FeaturedSpotlight`) currently call `categoryFor`
  per app, and (b) a defined default bucket for un-enumerated apps — which must
  render as a real, labelled group rather than a blank category, so shipping
  editorial with a partial `appRefs[]` degrades gracefully instead of stripping
  labels off cards. `appstoreCategories.test.ts` pins the current derivation and
  must be rewritten deliberately, not incidentally.
- **Read runtime shape from the manifest, not the entry** (§3.7):
  `install_from_registry` takes `resources`/`lifecycle` from the `app.json` it
  already fetches, and the registry no longer carries them.
- **Installed state = local receipt ∪ declarative probe** (§3.7). The shell
  `detectInstalled` path is deleted **for entries from every source**, not just the
  official document — the same loop serves owner-configured external registries and
  edition-contributed rows, and those are the *less* trusted sources, so leaving the
  key honored there would keep the shell exec reachable by the higher-risk path.
  `platform.externalInstall` is evaluated natively (bundle-id lookup, `PATH`
  resolution). Detect and report, never act.
- **Enforce the content pin at install time**, not just at publish: refuse to
  install an official entry whose `source` lacks an immutable pin
  (§3.1). The publish pipeline should make this unreachable; the client check is
  the backstop that makes it true regardless of who produced the document.
- **Source dispatch**: one `switch` on `source.type` selecting a fetcher, with a
  fail-closed default for unknown types, plus the legacy flat→tagged
  normalization at the read boundary (belt-and-braces with the publish-time
  normalization in §2). Host trust stays a separate gate from transport (§3.2).
- **`pickFeatured()` becomes a fallback**, not the primary path: when a valid
  editorial doc is present, the Discover layout is driven by `sections[]`; when
  it's absent/invalid (bottom of the ladder), the current heuristic renders.
- **`refresh_registries()`** extended to refetch the official registry +
  editorial doc alongside configured external registries, with the same
  per-source `{ok, refreshed, failed}` reporting.
- **Installed-app reconciliation**: on refresh, cross-check installed apps
  against tombstones and surface the `advice` (warn / offer disable / offer
  uninstall). This is the only path by which an already-installed app learns it
  was pulled.
- **Bundled fallback generation**: a build step (or bot PR) pulls the current
  *published* document (§2) and writes `kiro_crew/apps/app-registry.json` as the
  compiled snapshot — including its tombstones, so an offline client still
  honors removals.

---

## 7. Rollout

1. **Contract + data + generated publish.** In `KiroCrewApps`, land the two JSON
   Schemas (co-located, versioned from `schemaVersion: 1`, `source` as a closed
   discriminated union with `git` only) and populate the authored catalog (seeded
   from the current bundled entries) + an initial `editorial.json`. Build the
   validate-normalize-stamp-**sign**-publish workflow (§2) as the *only* path to
   the CDN.
2. **Tier refactor (prerequisite).** Replace the overloaded `_registry` boolean
   with `_tier` and repoint featuring, verified-badging, and credential posture at
   it (§6), updating the tests that encode the old ordering. Doing this first is
   what makes step 3 land as designed instead of shipping official apps as
   unverified and un-featurable.
3. **Client (read path).** Official-tier fetch with **signature verification as
   the acceptance gate** + merge (incl. the edition seam) + tombstone application
   in the shared lookup path + validated caching + the fallback ladder. Source
   dispatch with fail-closed unknown types. `pickFeatured()` demoted to fallback.
   Bundled snapshot generated from the published document.
4. **Editorial-driven Discover.** Render `sections[]`; keep the heuristic as the
   floor. Ship the first curated layout.
5. **Schema → SDK migration (later).** Once published app-author tooling or the
   client consume the schema directly, move the schema files to
   `KiroCrewAppSDK`, publish them from there, and repoint the validator import.
   The wire `schemaVersion` is unchanged, so no published-doc consumer is
   affected.

---

## 8. Open questions

Cross-references to these use **names, not numbers**, so resolving one never
leaves a stale pointer elsewhere in the document.

1. **Editorial cadence & authoring UX** — hand-edited JSON in `KiroCrewApps`
   with schema validation in CI (proposed) vs a small authoring tool. Who
   curates, and how often?
2. **Snapshot-sync mechanism** — build-time generation vs scheduled bot PR into
   `KiroCrew`. Trade-off: build-time is always fresh but couples the KiroCrew
   build to a `KiroCrewApps` fetch; a bot PR keeps the build hermetic but can
   lag. *(This is why §2's table marks that row open rather than settled.)*
3. **Schema version scheme** — integer majors (proposed, matches the installed-
   app `schemaVersion: int`) vs semver on the schema. Integer is simpler for the
   skip-unknown/full-fallback split.
4. **Which transport lands second** — `archive`+`sha256` (simplest, and the
   natural fit for an internal artifact store) vs `s3` (SigV4, needs the
   credential-grant answer below) vs `oci`. v1 ships `git` only; the enum slot is
   reserved either way, and each one costs a fetcher + a host-trust decision, not
   just a schema variant.
5. **Signing key custody** — §5 answers the *structure* (an offline root key
   signing metadata that designates one active signing key, so rotation and
   revocation are both publishes rather than app releases). What remains is
   operational and needs a security owner: where the offline root private key
   lives and who can operate it, who is authorized to sign a publish, how signing
   is gated in CI, and what the metadata expiry interval should be.
6. **Per-repository credential grants** — §5 settles the tier question (no tier
   ever confers ambient credentials) but not the mechanism: if an internal git
   farm or S3 bucket genuinely needs authenticated reads, what does an explicit
   per-repository grant look like, who authors it, and is it owner-local config
   rather than anything a fetched index can influence?

7. **Who evaluates `platform.externalInstall`, and when?** "Evaluated by KiroCrew,
   never by a shell" does not name the evaluating process, the cadence (on browse vs
   on `refresh_registries()`), or the result for a platform the descriptor omits —
   the example covers macOS and Linux, leaving Windows undefined (not-installed vs
   unknown). "Detect and report, never act" has no enforcement point until this is
   pinned.
8. **Deprecation path for legacy entry fields.** §3.7 has entries ignore
   `resources`/`lifecycle`/`detectInstalled`, which is safe but silently removes
   external-app detection for owner-configured external registries and
   edition-contributed rows. Ignore quietly, warn, or honor for non-official tiers
   during a deprecation window?
9. **Is the single-category dedup assertion a hard merge gate or a warning?** §4
   states the publish step asserts the flattened membership list has no duplicates.
   Failing the publish is the strict reading; a warning is the lenient one. The
   invariant only holds if it is a gate.

**Resolved in-doc** (previously listed here; recorded so the decision isn't
relitigated):

- **Feed transport is HTTPS/CDN JSON**, not the git-clone pipeline. This is no
  longer optional: §2's immutable-per-revision publish, §5's host-pin +
  signature, and §6's single fetcher/cache all assume an HTTPS document. It fits
  the existing distribution CDN, is edge-cacheable, and needs no clone sandbox
  for the index. (Individual *apps* are still cloned per `source.type`.)
- **Signature is required in v1**, not a fast-follow, and no tier confers ambient
  clone credentials (§5).
- **Tombstones live inline** in the registry document (§3.6).
- **This RFC owns the `app.json` additions** in §3.7, superseding
  `rfc-federated-app-platform` §3.3's manifest table. That table is stale rather
  than unimplemented: `AppManifest` covers most of it, but its one substantive
  manifest change (removing `backend`) never shipped and several live fields are
  absent from it. Gating this change on a table the code has already outgrown would
  block indefinitely. The authoritative manifest is `AppManifest` in code.

## 9. Success criteria

- Adding/removing/re-featuring an app is a `KiroCrewApps` PR that reaches
  clients within one cache TTL — **no app release**.
- A new editorial section `type` renders on new clients and is invisible (not
  broken) on old ones.
- With the CDN unreachable or the doc malformed, the Discover page still renders
  from cache → bundled snapshot → heuristic, with no blank state and no
  phantom/spoofed apps.
- The official registry's `featured` is honored; a user-external registry's is
  still ignored.
- **A tombstoned app disappears from Discover even on a client serving a stale
  cached index, and is not installable by name either.** An already-installed copy
  surfaces the removal advice. Neither a failed fetch nor a document that merely
  omits the tombstone resurrects it.
- **An unsigned or signature-failing official document grants no trust** — the
  client falls through to cache/bundled instead of honoring its featuring.
- **No remotely-fetched entry ever clones with ambient credentials**, regardless
  of tier — official, edition, and user-external all clone credential-free in a
  strict sandbox.
- **Official apps are featurable and show as verified**, proving the `_tier`
  refactor actually landed (the `_registry` boolean would have made both false).
- **An invalid catalog cannot reach the CDN** — the publish workflow is the only
  write path and validates first.
- **No official entry can be installed from a mutable ref** — every
  such entry carries an immutable pin, enforced at publish AND at install.
- **Discover renders and searches with zero per-app manifest fetches**, from the
  baked fields alone.
- **The category taxonomy changes without a client release** (closes #581), and an
  unknown category never hides an app.
- **Signing-key rotation AND revocation require no app release** — publishing new
  root-signed key metadata is sufficient, and the superseded key stops being
  accepted. Only root-key compromise needs a client update.
- **The registry contains no curator-authored presentation and no executable
  string** — re-labelling or re-ordering a category is an editorial edit that never
  touches the catalog, and the client runs no command supplied by a fetched
  document. (Changing an app's own generated `displayName`/`summary` does ride a
  republish, by design — §3.4.)
- **An app cannot place itself in a curated category** by editing its own
  manifest, and an app in two categories fails the publish gate.
- **Discover renders and searches with zero per-app manifest fetches**, from the
  baked fields alone.
- Adding a second `source.type` requires no schema-major bump and no change to
  any existing entry.
